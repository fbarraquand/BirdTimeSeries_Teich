# Code structure

We describe here how to obtain the main results shown in Figures in the article (main text and supplementary material). Further details are given in `README` files in the mentioned folders.  

### Main text

* **Figure 1** is drawn by `SCRIPTS/average_abundance.R`.
* **Figure 2** is produced by `SCRIPTS/Fig2.R`. It calls the function `SCRIPTS/test_synchrony_Gross.r` to compute the observed synchrony value and the associated p-value. 
* **Figure 3** is produced by `SCRIPTS/use_iaaft_community.r`. The top panel is plotted by calling the function `SCRIPTS/test_synchrony_Gross.r` (same use as above). The bottom panel is plotted by calling the function `SCRIPTS/image_mvcwt_for_colormaps.r` to draw p-values extracted from synchrony values computed with mvcwt package and randomization based on `SCRIPTS\iaaft.R`.
* **Figure 4** is produced by `SCRIPTS/use_iaaft_wavelet_wader.r`, based on `SCRIPTS/image_mvcwt_for_colormaps.r` (similarly as the bottom panel for Figure 3).
* **Figure 5** is drawn by `SCRIPTS/analyseP_oiseaux_Teich2_synchrony_reduced.R`.
* **Figure 6** is produced by `SCRIPTS/use_iaaft_triad.r` (same functioning as Figure 3).

### Supplementary material

* **Figure S1** and **Figure S2** are drawn by `SCRIPTS/analyseP_oiseaux_Teich2_synchrony_reduced.R`.
* **Figure S3** is produced by `SCRIPTS/explo/Gross_triad.R`, using `SCRIPTS/test_synchrony_Gross.r`.
* **Figure S4** is drawn by `SCRIPTS/analyseP_oiseaux_Teich2_synchrony_reduced.R`. 
* **Figure S5** is produced by `SCRIPTS/Fig2.R`. It calls the function `SCRIPTS/test_synchrony_Gross.r` to compute the observed synchrony value and the associated p-value. 
* **Figure S6** is produced by `SCRIPTS/use_iaaft_wavelet_wader.r`, based on `SCRIPTS/image_mvcwt_for_colormaps.r` (same as Figure 4).
* **Figure S7** is drawn by `SCRIPTS/verif_simulation.R`. Time series themselves are produced by `SCRIPTS/simulation_data.R`
* **Figure S8**, **Figure S9** and **Figure S10** are drawn by `SCRIPTS/plot_analyse_simulation.R`, based on the simulations produced in `SCRIPTS/simulation_data.R` and analysed by `SCRIPTS/analyse_simulation.R` using `SCRIPTS/test_synchrony_Gross.r`.
* **Figure S11** is produced by `SCRIPTS/use_iaaft_simulation_with_missing_data.r`, using `SCRIPTS/image_mvcwt_for_colormaps.r`.
* **Figure S12** is drawn by `Submission_JAE/Revisions_R2/Simulations_response/time_series.R`. Time series themselves are produced by `Submission_JAE/Revisions_R2/Simulations_response/MultivariateNormalModels_SAD.R`. 
* **Figure S13**, **Figure S14** and **Figure S15** are produced by `Submission_JAE/Revisions_R2/Simulations_response/use_iaaft_simulations.r`, using `SCRIPTS/test_synchrony_Gross.r` and `SCRIPTS/image_mvcwt_for_colormaps.r`.
* **Figure S16** and **Figure S17** are produced by `Submission_EcolEvol/Simulations_response/MultivariateNormalModels_SAD_MultiTrends.R`, using `SCRIPTS/test_synchrony_Gross.r`and `SCRIPTS/image_mvcwt_for_colormaps.r`.
* **Figure S18** is produced by `Submission_EcolEvol/Simulations_response/MultivariateNormalModels_SAD.R`, relying on `SCRIPTS/image_mvcwt_for_colormaps.r`.
* **Figure S19** is produced by `Submission_EcolEvol/Simulations_response/MultivariateNormalModels_2sp_antiphase_log_amplitude.R`, relying on `SCRIPTS/image_mvcwt_for_colormaps.r`. 

NOTE 1: It should be noted that there are more source code files than necessary to produce all results, some analyses being exploratory or used as first steps towards final programs. Also, some simulation programs were put in Revision folders (mostly in `Submission_JAE/Revisions/Simulations_response`,`Submission_JAE/Revisions_R2/Simulations_response` and `Submission_EcolEvol/Revisions/Simulations_response`).   

NOTE 2: Some functions may require to un-comment/re-comment calls to other functions, depending on possibly conflicting or repeated dependencies in separate files.
