\begin_layout Abstract
Compensatory dynamics, during which community composition shifts despite
 a near-constant total community size, are usually rare: synchronous dynamics
 prevail in natural communities.
 This is a puzzle for ecologists, because of the key role of compensation
 in explaining the relation between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.
 However, most studies so far have considered compensation in either plants
 or planktonic organisms, so that evidence for the generality of such synchrony
 is limited.
 Here, we extend analyses of community-level synchrony to wetland birds.
 We analyse a 35-year monthly survey of a community where we suspected that
 compensation might occur due to changes in water levels, favouring birds
 with different habitat preferences, and potential competition.
 We perform both year-to-year analyses by season, using a compensation/synchrony
 index, as well as multiscale analyses using a wavelet-based measure, which
 allows for both scale- and time-dependence.
 We analyse synchrony both within and between guilds, with guilds defined
 either as tightknit phylogenetic groups or larger functional groups.
 We find that abundance and biomass compensation is rare, likely due to
 the synchronizing influence of climate (and other drivers) on birds, even
 after considering several temporal scales of covariation (during either
 cold or warm seasons, above or below the annual scale).
 Negative covariation in abundance at the guild or community level did only
 appear at the scale of a few months or several years.
 We also found that synchrony varies with taxonomic and functional scale:
 the rare cases where compensation appeared consistently in year-to-year
 analyses were 
\emph on
between
\emph default
 rather than 
\emph on
within
\emph default
 guilds, using functional groups.
 Our results suggest that abundance compensation may have more potential
 to emerge between broad functional groups rather than between species,
 as well as at relatively long temporal scales (multiple years for vertebrates),
 above that of the dominant synchronizing driver.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Density compensation occurs when individuals of a given species replace
 individuals of other species within a community, either because of explicit
 competitive processes or shifts in environmental drivers that change selection
 pressures 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gonzalez2009causes"

\end_inset

.
 The community as a whole then exhibits lower abundance variation than its
 constituent species 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gross2013species"
literal "true"

\end_inset

: some degree of compensation or asynchrony is therefore a prerequisite
 to stabilization at the community level

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Understanding why environmental variation may lead to compensation is relatively
 easy: if species have different environmental preferences (e.g., thermal
 optima), and the environment changes over time, different species will
 be fittest

\end_inset

 at different points in time.
 As a consequence, relative abundances will shift over time even though
 the community abundance or biomass as a whole may remain relatively stable
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gonzalez2009causes"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 However, the conditions for compensation to happen also depend on the particula
rs of the interactions between and within species in the community.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Compensation is particularly likely to occur when temporal environmental
 variation combines with a space constraint or with a strongly limiting
 resource, so that individuals are close to competing in a zero-sum game
 (sensu 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "hubbell2001unified"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 or lottery-style models, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "chesson_multispecies_1994"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 When the total community size is constant over time, and the composition
 fluctuates, negative covariation between abundances then emerges by design
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "loreau_species_2008"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 since no species can increase without at least another species decreasing
 in abundance.
 Outside of this zero-sum scenario, in models where Lotka-Volterra competition
 is combined with temporal environmental variability, theoretical research
 has revealed that increased interspecific competition might not always
 increase species compensation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ives_stability_1999"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and might even decrease it 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
before "i.e., increase species synchrony instead,"
key "loreau_species_2008,loreau2013biodiversity"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, though this depends on the fluctuation regime.
 Thus, in a world where total community size varies, predicting whether
 compensatory dynamics can occur is intrinsically difficult 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "klink_functional_2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Early investigations of the frequency of synchronous vs compensatory dynamics
 focused on the variance ratio, that is, the variance of the sum of the
 community biomass divided by the sum of the variance of the component species
 biomasses 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "houlahan_compensatory_2007,gonzalez2009causes"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Unfortunately, this metric is not appropriate for communities subjected
 to community-wide environmental forcing 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ranta_detecting_2008"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, because a main environmental driver (e.g., temperature or light) may synchronize
 species abundances or growth rates at some temporal scale, creating large
 variance in community-wide biomass, in spite of strongly competitive dynamics.
 Further research has therefore focused on specific timeframes during which
 compensatory dynamics may be found (e.g., below the annual scale at which
 temperature fluctuations tend to synchronize species dynamics, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "vasseur_synchronous_2014"

\end_inset

).

Despite efforts to look for more meaningful temporal scales in community-level
 time series, temporal compensation has remained surprinsingly elusive in
 the field

 in beetles).
 Here, we take advantage of a long-term bird abundance time series in a
 natural reserve, with records every month for 35 years, allowing us to
 dig deeper into patterns of synchrony, at several temporal and taxonomic
 or functional scales.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Taxonomic and functional scales should indeed be main modulators of synchrony/co
mpensation.
 On the one hand, compensation can be high between similar and closely related
 species.
 If two species of ducks A and B share almost the same niche, individuals
 from either species experience similar competition from species A or B,
 and should feel the effects of other species in the community identically.
 This favours priority effects 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "fukami_historical_2015"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, with chance due to movement events determining whether species A or B
 locally dominates, which can then provide compensation at the landscape
 level 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "loreau2003biodiversity"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 On the other hand, it could be argued that these two similar duck species
 will precisely respond in similar ways to environmental variables, which
 tends to obfuscate compensation.
 Hence, more dissimilar species or groups (within the same trophic level
 nonetheless) could exhibit more compensation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "bai2004ecosystem,morin2014temporal,klink_functional_2019"

\end_inset

 because they are more likely to respond to the environment in an asynchronous
 manner (

 Surprisingly, such compensation

 In this paper, we explore the level of compensation/synchrony within or
 between guilds of a wetland bird community, along either taxonomic or functiona
l classifications.
 Although a functional classification might appear intuitively more appealing,
 our knowledge of functional traits is necessarily partial and imperfect,
 so that a taxonomic description can sometimes be preferable

 Our dataset is ideally suited to examine the presence of synchrony or compensat
ion at different scales given that (i) it is a highly temporally resolved
 time series with respect to the species typical generation times, but it
 also extends well beyond generation time (timespan of 35 years) and (ii)
 the reserve where the data has been collected was subjected to a major
 management change c.
 2006 (change in water levels), favouring different types of wetland birds
 (so that over long timescales, there is a real potential for changes in
 community composition).

\end_inset

 sectors where the counts are actually performed, using binoculars).
 We use for each species the maximum observed abundance over a month, which
 provides a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

monthly snapshot
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the bird abundance, that has been used to monitor the reserve since
 its inception.
 When abundance values are not reported for certain species and months,
 we replace them by zeroes.
 Given the sustained observation effort (all sectors are patrolled multiple
 times throughout the month by the staff, amateur ornithologists visiting
 the reserve daily and communicating their findings to the reserve staff),
 we consider that the absence of counts for a given species signals its
 true absence from the reserve.
 This creates some zero abundances for rare species at the monthly scale.
 We have not attempted to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

correct
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 those zeroes (e.g., inferring the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

missing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 data with a model assuming that our reserve is a subsample of a regional
 population) because doing so would have compromised the patterns of local
 synchrony/compensation.
 However, we did check that having such zeroes in the monthly time series
 cannot affect our conclusions (see SI).
 In the statistical analyses, we use seasonally averaged abundances (plotted
 in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Temporal-trends"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), as well as the original monthly data (presented in Appendix S2).
 We defined two seasons based on observations of bird presence.
 We defined a `warm season', from May to August, and a `cold season' as
 the months between November and February of the following year.
 From an ecological viewpoint, this seasonal classification separates wintering
 birds from summer residents (some of whom are breeding).
 This makes sense biologically because the two communities have different
 requirements and could respond differentially to abiotic drivers.
 It is also useful from a more statistical perspective, as there is a partial
 shift in composition between the seasons, though winter and summer communities
 greatly overlap (i.e., species with greater abundances in the reserve in
 winter have also some summer residents, though these may be different individua
ls).
 The dynamics of species abundances in the Teich reserve bird community
 show a marked signature of seasonality (Fig.

 Waders and ducks have different environmental preferences, with ducks (and
 waterfowl more generally) preferring water levels allowing them to dabble

 A list of all birds found frequently in the reserve is presented in Appendix

 egrets and cormorants (see below).
 Among the fish eaters, grebes and gulls were frequently counted; a few

 That is, we constructed two community-level time series of species abundances,
 one for the cold season and one for the warm season.
 To do so, we averaged monthly bird abundances, for each species, over the
 season duration.
 In follow-up analyses, we also differentiated periods before and after
 2006, given that a management change occurred within the reserve in 2006.
 We considered both the synchrony within a given guild (e.g., among species
 of the 
\shape italic

\shape default
 genus) or between guilds (e.g., between the summed abundances of the 7 species
 of tribe 
\shape italic
Anatini
\shape default
 and
\emph on
 
\shape italic
the sum of the 6 
\emph default

 species).
 In the latter case of between-guilds comparisons, we summed species together
 before seasonal averaging, to consider seasonal averages of the monthly
 guild-level abundance.

 Finally, we computed

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We computed the statistical significance of the synchrony index by comparing
 the observed values to the distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 under the null hypothesis 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gouhier_synchrony_2014"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, which amounts to cross-correlations of value zero between species abundances
 (or guild-level abundances, when considering taxonomic or functional groups).
 The challenge, in order to construct such null hypothesis, is to remove
 all cross-correlations while keeping the exact same autocorrelation in
 each individual time series.
 Therefore, for each set of time series (each combination year 
\begin_inset Formula $\times$
\end_inset

 season for a given community), we constructed 1000 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

surrogates
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in which we kept auto-correlations but removed cross-correlations between
 time series.
 There are multiple ways to erase cross-correlations depending on the resolution
 of the considered community.
 Within guilds, we shifted the time-series 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "purves_fine-scale_2002"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 while between guilds (two groups only), we used a frequency-based approach
 (Iterative Amplitude-Adjusted Fourier Transform or IAAFT, see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "schreiber_surrogate_2000"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 We first explain the shift-based approach: the suite of abundance values
 (after seasonal averaging) is displaced by a random temporal lag 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, so that a value 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}$
\end_inset

 is now found at 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t+\tau}$
\end_inset

.
 At the boundary (the end of the time series), remaining points are displaced
 towards the beginning of the time-series, which implements a toroidal shift.
 This method works well when comparing many times series corresponding to
 the multiple species.
 However, when computing synchrony across only two groups (between guilds),
 spurious cross-correlations could emerge with a shift-based approach as
 the number of possible combinations is more limited.
 Therefore, to test for synchrony between the summed abundances of two guilds
 or taxonomic units, we used the more sophisticated IAAFT method 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "schreiber_surrogate_2000"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, which retains the frequency spectrum of the time series while randomising
 its values.
 We obtained 1000 sets of randomised time series for each computed synchrony
 index.
 We then compared the number of 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{H0}$
\end_inset

 values which exceeded or were inferior to the observed value to compute
 the p-value 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "north_note_2002"
literal "false"

\end_inset

: we use the ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $(r+1)/(n+1)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is the number of surrogate values that are 
\begin_inset Formula $\ge\eta_{obs}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\le\eta_{obs}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is the number of surrogates.
 Independence of species was rejected at the 10% threshold with a Benjamini-Hoch
berg correction, as we compare across 2 seasons and 3 periods (all years,
 before 2006, after 2006), with partially overlapping data.
 This was found satisfactory based on simulated data, although power is
 low for detecting compensation (i.e., the null cannot always be rejected)
 when only two groups are compared.

Wavelet analyses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to the time-domain analyses above, we performed wavelet analyses
 at multiple temporal scales, ranging from a month to several years.
 Wavelet analyses provide information on community synchrony for a given
 temporal scale or frequency, as well as a given location in time along
 the time series.
 This was done at the whole community level, including the 60 most frequent
 bird species, and for the rich wader and waterfowl communities, as well
 as the group formed by the great cormorant, grey heron and little egret.
 All wavelet analyses take as input the monthly time series data.

 and stored at Zenodo [will be done for the final version] (Picoche, Aluome

 Finally, we want to highlight a conceptual issue worth keeping in mind:
 both 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 indicate synchrony when reaching one, but such synchrony should be understood
 as the reciprocal of compensation rather than exactly synchronized peaks
 and troughs for all species (i.e., phase synchrony).
 Unlike phase synchrony, compensation and community-level synchrony depend
 on the distribution of abundance variation within the community.
 In the limit case where a single species abundance fluctuates more than
 all others combined, compensation may not even be reachable, since variation
 in the abundance of that dominant species cannot be offset by changes in
 numbers of other species.
 Only when species densities have commensurate temporal variability will
 the concepts of community-level synchrony and phase synchrony exactly match.

 The

 synchrony indices are indeed mostly positive, and always positive whenever
 significantly different from the null hypothesis of no temporal correlation
 between species.
 Therefore, there is no compensation within guilds (Fig.

For the cold season, abundances within

 becoming less synchronous over time, although we should mention that these
 changes are not statistically significant.
 For the warm season, the management change, which consisted of lowering
 the water levels, created little change in communities of species within
 the

: they are all synchronous.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though there is no widespread community-wide or genus-wide compensation
 across years (separating the two seasons), there could be compensation
 at finer temporal scales, e.g.
 a month or two, or coarser scales, over several years.
 Such compensation could also occur at specific time intervals instead of
 throughout the whole time series, a time-dependency that wavelet analyses
 allow to reveal.
 When we consider the wavelet modulus ratio (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Wavelet-modulus-ratio"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), that is, a time-varying and scale-dependent strength of synchrony, we
 can see that there is synchrony even at a fine temporal scale throughout
 most of the time series.
 However, post-2006, there seems to be a possibility for episodic compensation
 on a temporal scale of approximately 2-4 months, for both waders and waterfowl.
 There could also be within-guild compensation at scales of 5 years, approximate
ly post-2000 for waders and pre-2005 for waterfowl.
 Waterfowl synchrony trends likely influence whole-community trends (Fig.

We thus find contrasted results regarding the effect of the management change
 on synchrony within guilds or within the whole bird community, depending
 on the type of analyses.
 Year-to-year analyses yield unclear results for both guilds.
 At shorter (one or two months) and longer (five years) timescales though,
 wavelet analyses show that the management change may decrease synchrony
 and even promote compensation.

Synchrony in a small module with known competition

Compensation could be expected upon visual inspection of the time series

 plus grey heron (summed as a small functional group) on the other hand
 (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 However, we see on Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Time-domain-(top)-and"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 that synchrony is in fact the rule around the annual scale and below, when
 considering the wavelet modulus ratio.
 We wondered if the patterns in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Time-series-of"
plural "false"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 were caused by the use of a log scale, but we found that in fact the correlatio
n was higher rather than lower on the log scale (Appendix S3).
 However, over long temporal scales (
\begin_inset Formula $\sim$
\end_inset

 8 years) we observe consistent compensation, which could correspond to
 the slow change in composition observed within this small community module,
 that was already visible on the abundance time series plot (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).
 There is some statistically significant compensation over shorter timescales
 as well, but only at very specific times.
 The absence of marked compensation at short temporal scales may be an inevitabl
e consequence of the difference in the amplitude of temporal variation between
 the two groups (Appendix S8), as opposite annual phases for the two time
 series can be observed before 2000 (Fig.

 The latter index scales from 0 (compensation, blue color) to 1 (synchrony,

\begin_layout Standard
Between-species compensation was not found across years (for two separate
 seasons), synchrony between species being the rule.
 In other words, there was no widespread

 genera or guilds in year-to-year analyses of cold and warm seasons.
 Yet, summing the abundances of species within a guild and comparing these
 total abundances of contrasted guilds, it was possible to find compensation
 across years, during the cold season corresponding to wintering birds (although
 the null hypothesis of no correlation could not be rejected); that is,
 there was compensation

 guilds.
 These results are robust to using biomass in place of abundance (SI Appendix
 S4).
 A zoom on a module of three species with known competition also revealed
 clear compensation at scales

 years.
 We elaborate below on these findings.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given that we compare the level of synchrony/compensation within guilds
 (with many species) and between guilds (with only a handful of groups),
 we checked in Appendix S5, using the dynamical model of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "gross2013species"

\end_inset

, if changing the number of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

compartments
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

) in the index 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 could affect its value.
 It did not have marked effects, unless the number of compartments is equal
 to 2, in which case significance is hard to achieve and some compensatory
 dynamics can be missed with weak environmental response.
 Additionally, we found – still using this dynamical model – that if two
 guilds respond in opposite ways to a shared environmental driver, the stronger
 the response of growth rates to the driver, the lesser the compensation
 indicated by 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 at the whole community level.
 An intuitive explanation of this modelling result is that when there are
 two groups and many species within a group, a stronger forcing homogeneizes
 the dynamics within a group as much as it creates differences between groups.
 This might explain the low levels of compensation that we found in our
 empirical dataset, at the overall wetland bird community level (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:synchrony-whole-comm"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), in spite of the clear presence of two guilds (waders and waterfowl) reacting
 in opposite way to a shared driver (here, water levels).
 Analyses at several taxonomic/functional scales are therefore warranted
 to be conclusive about compensation, which mirrors what was suggested by
 earlier plant studies 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

before "e.g.,"
key "bai2004ecosystem"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Future case studies with more than two main functional groups may be instructiv
e, to challenge the generality of our findings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We used correlation between the summed abundances of closely related species
 (species within the 
\shape italic
Anatini 
\emph on
tribe
\shape default
\emph default
 vs species within the 
\shape italic

\shape default
 genus) or the summed abundances of functionally similar species (waders
 vs waterfowl) to uncover compensation.
 The functional group classification produced some compensation between
 guilds while the taxonomic classification did not, despite the contrasted
 habitat preferences of these two phylogenetic groups.
 Using functional groups produced more logical results, although as we stressed
 above, due to the low power of the tests, the null hypothesis of no compensatio
n at the yearly scale was still plausible as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We expected to see compensation at the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

functional group scale
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for both cold and warm seasons.
 The separation of seasons allowed to differentiate summer residents (some
 of whom may be breeding) and wintering birds, in order to remove the overwhelmi
ng influence of the seasonal migratory cycle.
 In both of those seasons though, we had reason to expect waders and waterfowl
 to have different environmental preferences.
 Instead, waders and waterfowl were found to correlate negatively only during
 the cold (wintering) season.
 A simple explanation is that the reserve might be closer to its carrying
 capacity for these species in winter, so that space is limited and increases
 in one functional group are compensated by decreases in the other.
 The dominant species in each guild (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Temporal-trends"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), such as 
\emph on
C.
 alpina
\emph default
 for waders and 
\emph on
A.
 crecca
\emph default
 for waterfowl, are migratory species which are much more abundant in winter
 than summer in that area, which adds to the plausibility of the reserve
 reaching carrying capacity.
 Of course, the space constraint should not be taken too literally: birds
 are obviously mobile and do forage outside of the reserve (e.g., waders moving
 to the nearby Arcachon bay mudflats), but there are costs to those movements
 (energetics, mortality risk due to nearby hunting) which make the reserve
 a very attractive wintering site where birds both rest and forage to some
 degree.
 Packing even more birds over its 120 ha may just not be feasible, so that
 increases in one guild result in decrease in the other

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Compensation might therefore be easier to detect during the cold season
 because the study area is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

filled
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and it is not detected in our warm season (May to August) because there
 are less birds overall.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It may be better to say that we detected

compensation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 rather than

compensatory dynamics
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 between bird species 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gonzalez2009causes"

\end_inset

, if compensatory dynamics is thought to result from births and deaths,
 i.e., population dynamics.
 Indeed, the observed long-term changes in species composition (more waders,
 proportionally less waterfowl; Appendix S2) is likely due to an increased
 inflow of birds preferring low water levels (waders), and outflow of birds
 preferring high water levels (waterfowl), under an overall space constraint
 (at least in winter, as we explained above).
 Bird settlement decisions for both winter and spring/summer seasons are
 the proximal causes of bird species composition in the reserve, rather
 than population dynamics.
 However, it would be incorrect to conclude that because the local compensation
 in winter that we found results from bird behaviour, it is disconnected
 from regional-scale community dynamics: which species are present in the
 reserve - safe from hunting - affects ultimately their survival and reproductiv
e success, which then feeds back into the regional-scale community dynamics.

\begin_layout Subsection*
Effect of the change in management on synchrony
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although we performed a first set of analyses using the whole time series,
 we have also performed year-to-year analyses pre- and post-2006.
 The reason for these additional analyses is that a marked change in management
 occurred around 2006, after which the water levels were lower.
 Separating pre-/post-2006 and comparing to the previous analyses allows
 to disentangle the effect of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

normal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 dynamics from the effect of this management change.
 Pre- and post-2006 analyses showed very little differences with whole time
 series analyses for either the warm or cold season.
 However, in the wavelet modulus ratio analyses, we see at monthly or 5-year
 timescales more compensation after 2006 for waders; this could reflect
 that the community is becoming saturated with waders.
 The effects of disturbances on the level of synchrony or compensation are
 likely idiosyncratic: for instance, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "keitt_coherent_2008"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 found increased synchrony after disturbance while 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

 found no clear effect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Synchrony in a small module with known competition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now zoom in on the cormorant-heron-egret module, for which we knew beforehand
 that competition for resting and roosting sites in the summer season occurs
 between, on the one hand, great cormorants, and on the other hand, little
 egrets and grey herons (C.
 Feigné, pers.
 obs.).
 Abundance time series suggested some negative correlation, but it was not
 found in year-to-year analyses for which synchrony (or an absence of relation)
 dominates.
 Instead, we find that compensation mostly occurs on a scale of 8 years,
 much above the annual scale, which is a likely consequence of the slow
 shift in frequencies of cormorants and little egrets / grey herons.
 The reason why we do not find a compensation at the monthly to annual scale
 pre-2000 in spite of some opposition of annual phases may be related to
 the large difference in the amplitude of short-term temporal variation
 between the two groups.
 When one functional group or species dominates the temporal variation,
 as shown in SI Appendix S8, its dominance of temporal variation can forbid
 the occurrence of compensation since by definition no increase in the numbers
 of the species that fluctuate less may compensate for the decreases in
 the species that fluctuate more (and vice versa).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Conclusion and perspectives for theory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall, our results suggest to search for compensation more often
\emph on
 between
\emph default
 rather than 
\emph on
within
\emph default
 functional groups, and over relatively long timescales, above the typical
 temporal autocorrelation of the dominant driver (e.g., above 5 years if the
 main driver is a seasonal climate).
 This rejoins the recent findings of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "klink_functional_2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 who found that increased functional differences between species tend to
 decrease synchrony in beetles, as well as earlier results of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "bai2004ecosystem"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 on negative covariation of plant functional groups.
 Our suggestion goes against calls to search for compensation within closely
 related species but at very short timescales 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "vasseur2007spectral,gonzalez2009causes"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, below the timescale of the main synchronizing seasonal environmental driver,
 in order to filter out precisely its synchronizing effect.
 Searching for compensation at temporal scales below the seasonal abiotic
 driver (e.g., temperature) was partly motivated by studies on plankton whose
 population dynamics are usually much faster than the dominant abiotic driver,
 with short generation times, so that the effects of competition may be
 manifest at the scale of a few weeks or months.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In theory, we could have expected compensation to manifest also at the smallest
 temporal scale of our survey (monthly).
 Indeed, the community dynamics in our case are driven by the movements
 and settlement decisions of birds, reacting to perceived food and space
 availability, rather than by births and deaths directly.
 Such behavioural dynamics can certainly be much faster than bird population
 dynamics, and could operate at the scale of weeks or months.
 However, such compensation due to short-term movements was not observed
 except perhaps in some years.
 We suspect that because many species share common abiotic drivers (e.g.,
 disturbances due to nearby hunting, local climatic conditions) fluctuating
 even within a single season, their dynamics can be synchronized by these
 drivers at monthly temporal scales.
 It is noteworthy that even in planktonic systems, the temporal scale of
 compensation has often been found to be well above that of the forcing
 driver 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "keitt_coherent_2008,brown2016compensatory"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Thus our findings reinforce previous suggestions to search for compensation
 over relatively long timescales (several years for vertebrates or plants).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The attractor of community dynamics, i.e., the shape of community trajectories
 in phase space, seems to be more or less an annual cycle here: the dominant
 species fluctuate seasonally, but even though there are shifts in some
 species dynamics, no abundant species seem to exhibit violent multi-year
 oscillations.
 If we had to describe our community mathematically, a dynamical model with
 a stable fixed point forced by seasonality and some noise would probably
 be appropriate.
 This mild fluctuation scenario somehow contrasts with the dynamics of other
 communities, such as insect pests, that have quite often multi-year cycles
 (on top of seasonal cycles, for multivoltine species), with possibly strong
 indirect interactions between similar species mediated by predators and
 parasitoids 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "murdoch2003consumer"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In the latter context of internally-generated variability (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Endogenous compensatory cycles" in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "gonzalez2009causes"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), compensation may be more likely: 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "klapwijk2018transient"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 recently reported only transient synchrony between species of moths, that
 typically exhibit such multi-year fluctuations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In many ways, searching for abundance compensation using biodiversity time
 series data is searching for needles in a haystack: only some specific
 temporal and functional/taxonomic scales allow to see compensation whilst
 numerous confounding factors make the community co-vary positively at all
 other scales 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "vasseur_synchronous_2014"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 When a common species fluctuates much more than the rest, this can also
 lessen or forbid compensation.
 Thus, although the knowledge of specific biological mechanisms increasing
 the densities of some species at the expense of others can help, synchrony
 will likely dominate community-level time series data for closely related
 species, even in species that compete strongly 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ranta_detecting_2008,loreau_species_2008"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 This is true even in cases of known mechanisms of competition for space
 or shifts in community composition due to abiotic changes affecting differentia
lly species preferences, as in this study.
 We therefore suggest that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

zooming out
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 functionally (considering summed abundances of dissimilar functional groups)
 and temporally (considering temporal scales well above the periodicity
 of the dominant abiotic driver) may often be the best strategy to see the
 compensation that will inevitably manifest at some scales, if the community-lev
el biomass is to be maintained within bounds in the long run.
