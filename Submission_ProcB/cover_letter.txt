Dear Editor, 

I would like to submit to Proceedings B, for consideration as a research article, our manuscript entitled "Looking for compensation at multiple scales in a wetland bird community". 

Community compensation occurs when decreases in the density of some species are offset by increases in the density of other species, so that total community size (or total biomass) fluctuates little. It is believed to be a key mechanism promoting ecosystem stability. 

However, this phenomenon has proven to be very elusive in field data, as synchrony in climate drivers often induces synchrony in species densities. This requires to look for compensation at various temporal scales (zooming in or out of the yearly temporal scale, which has been done a bit), and at various organizational scales, which a new feature of our article. 

In this manuscript, we study a wetland bird community that has been counted for 35 years. We not only compare the dynamics at several temporal scales but also several organizational scales (taxonomic or functional). While compensation has often been searched for within guilds made of similar species, we show it has potential to emerge between relatively different species guilds.  

We believe that our results can be of broad interest to both empiricists and theoreticians, as we extend previous empirical analyses of synchrony/compensation to new groups (birds), confirming the rarity of compensation found in plants and zooplankton, and we propose new ways in which groups of species might cluster in their environmental responses and intrinsic dynamics (synchronous dynamics within a guild, somewhat compensatory between guilds), which may help to structure future theoretical research on the topic.  

We look forward to hear from you, 

On behalf of all co-authors, 

Frederic Barraquand
