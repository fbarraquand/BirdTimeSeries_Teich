Compensatory dynamics, during which community composition shifts despite a near-constant total community size, are usually rare: synchronous
dynamics prevail in natural communities. This is a puzzle for ecologists, because of the key role of compensation to explain the relation between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. We take advantage of a long-term wetland bird community time series of 35 years, where we suspected that compensation might occur due to changes in water levels and known trends. We find that compensatory dynamics are still rare, likely due to the synchronizing influence of climate on birds, even after considering several temporal scales of covariation (during cold or warm seasons, above or below the seasonal scale). Negative covariation in abundance at the whole community level did only appear after a management change in the reserve, and at the scale of a few months or several years. Although most research has focused on the temporal scale of compensation vs. synchrony, we found that compensation varies with taxonomic and functional scale too: compensation appeared more frequently between rather than within guilds. This suggests that compensation has more potential to emerge between broad functional groups rather between species.
