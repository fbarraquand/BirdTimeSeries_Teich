\begin_layout Abstract
Compensatory dynamics, during which community composition shifts despite a near-constant total community size, are usually rare: synchronous dynamics prevail in natural communities. This is a puzzle for ecologists, because of the key role of compensation to explain the relation between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. We take advantage of a long-term wetland bird community time series of 35 years, where we suspected that compensation might occur due to changes in water levels and known trends. We find that compensatory dynamics are still rare, likely due to the synchronizing influence of climate on birds, even after considering several temporal scales of covariation (during cold or warm seasons, above or below the seasonal scale). Negative covariation in abundance at the whole community level did only appear after a management change in the reserve, and at the scale of a few months or several years. Although most research has focused on the temporal scale of compensation vs synchrony, we found that compensation varies with taxonomic and functional scale too: compensation appeared more frequently between rather than within guilds. This suggests that compensation has more potential to emerge between broad functional groups rather between species.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ecological theory suggests that within rich communities, where a number of species can have similar functions due to their proximity in morphological or phylogenetic space, they might exhibit compensatory dynamics

literal "true"

\end_inset

. Compensation occurs when individuals of some species replace individuals of other species, either because of explicit competitive processes or shifts in some environmental driver that change selection pressures. This is particularly likely to occur when there is a space or resource constraint combined with temporal environmental variability. Which species

\end_inset

 at any particular point in time may then depend on the fine-grained temporal environmental variation, or just on priority effects (i.e., who gets there first). Whatever the cause of compensatory dynamics, its main consequences for ecosystem functioning is that the community as a whole exhibits lower biomass variation than its constituent species 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

key "gross2013species"
literal "true"

\end_inset

. Compensation is therefore intertwined with community-level stability, at least when stability is understood as the reciprocal of variability. By contrast, another very frequent observed outcome on biodiversity time series is synchrony 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "vasseur_synchronous_2014"

\end_inset

. Synchrony occurs when all species fluctuate in phase, and therefore the biomass of the community may not fluctuate less than its constituent parts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Early investigations of the frequency of synchronous vs compensatory dynamics focused on the variance ratio, that is, the variance of the sum of the community biomass divided by the sum of the variance of the component species biomasses 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "ranta_detecting_2008"

\end_inset

, because a main environmental driver (e.g., temperature or light) may synchronize species abundances or growth rates at some scale, creating large variance in community-wide biomass, in spite of strongly competitive dynamics. Further research has therefore focused on specific timeframes where compensatory dynamics may be found (e.g., below the seasonal scale where temperature fluctuations tend to synchronize species dynamics,

), in a natural reserve, that allows us to dig deeper into patterns of synchrony, at several temporal and taxonomic or functional scales.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed, taxonomic scale should be a main modulator of synchrony/compensation, and this explanatory factor that has been somewhat neglected for now. On the one hand, one could argue that compensation should be higher between closely related species, because functional and phylogenetic differences are generally correlated. For example, if species A and B are two duck species that share almost the same food niche as well as many traits, it makes little difference to the rest of the community whether one species gets replaced by the other (functional compensation,
\emph on

\emph default
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt

\end_inset

) so that individuals from species A or B would experience similar competition. Priority effects and chance events could then determine whether duck species A or B dominates. On the other hand, it could be argued that these two similar duck species will precisely respond in similar ways to environmental variables, which tends to obfuscate compensation. Under the latter scenario, more dissimilar species, or groups of species (within the same trophic level nonetheless), could compensate each other within the whole community. This should occur because more dissimilar species are more likely to have different environmental preferences and the environment varies over time (e.g., groups of species preferring more open vs more closed habitats replacing each other as a function of changes in vegetation height). Surprisingly, such compensation

 guilds has been less well explored than within guilds, even though there is actually some empirical evidence for compensation between dissimilar guilds

. In this paper, we explore different ways to cluster the bird community, within or between guilds, along either taxonomic or functional classifications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our objective is therefore to examine how synchronous or compensatory bird communities are at different temporal and taxonomic (or functional) scales. Our dataset is ideally suited to the task given that (i) it is a highly temporally resolved time series with respect to the species typical generation times, but it also extends well beyond generation time (35 years) and (ii) the reserve where the data has been collected was subjected to a major management change c. 2006 (change in water levels), favouring different types of wetland birds (so that over long timescales, there is a real potential for changes in community composition).

\begin_layout Standard
The monthly time series used for the statistical analyses have been collected at the Teich Ornithological Reserve, Arcachon Bay, France (44.64°N / -1.02°E), by the staff of the Teich reserve. The reserve comprises 120 ha of wetlands, and the counts have been aggregated at the reserve scale. We use for each species the maximum observed abundance over a month, which provides a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the bird abundance. In the statistical analyses, we use both the original monthly data and seasonal averages. We defined two seasons based on observations of bird presence. We defined a `warm season', from May to August, and a `cold season' as the months between November and February of the following year. From an ecological viewpoint, this seasonal classification separates wintering birds from summer residents (some of whom are breeding). This makes sense biologically because the two communities have different requirements and respond differentially to abiotic drivers. It is also useful from a more statistical perspective, as there is a shift in composition between the seasons, though winter and summer communities partially overlap due to a number of shared species.

. We averaged monthly bird abundances, for each species, over the season duration, and computed the synchrony index using the year as our statistical unit. We also differentiated periods before and after 2006, given that a management change occurred within the reserve in 2006. We considered both the synchrony inside a given group (e.g., among species of the

We used both taxonomic classifications of the species (i.e., between and within genera) and functional classifications of the species (e.g., 30 species of waders versus 34 species of ducks) as we suspected that a functional classification may allow to partition better the abiotic requirements of the species. We use

Do we Bonferronni-correct? In this case, 5/16 for the 4 seasons? (4 groups/4 season?)Do we add the equation for the p-value? Doesn't feel necessary to me but what do you think? We'll discuss for the Bonferroni, but that makes sense if we do it below? In any case we don't need to mention more here if we add the codes to the GitHub repo. I don't Bonferroni-correct for now. Thinking about it, wouldn't it be 5/(3*6*2) (3 periods of time, 6 groups, 2 seasons) ? Bonferroni corrections might be too strong in this context, let's discuss that together. F: Perhaps we should Bonferroni correct after all, see my comments on the Appendix.

For the cold season,

 exhibit opposite trends in synchrony in response to the management change in 2006. However, for the warm season, the management change, which consisted in lowering the water levels, created more synchronous communities of species within the

 genera. This increase in synchrony after 2006 is matched by the functional group classification.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though there is no widespread community-wide or genus-wide compensation at the yearly timescale (differentiating the seasons), there could be compensation at finer temporal scales, e.g. a month or two, or coarser scales, over several years. The wavelet plot (Fig. 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

), that allows to consider a time-varying and scale-dependent strength of synchrony, suggests that there is synchrony even at a fine temporal scale throughout most of the time series. However, post-2006, there seems to be a possibility for overcompensation on a scale around 5 years or around 3-4 months.

There are therefore relatively contrasted results regarding the effect of the management change on short-term synchrony within the wader community. At the yearly (season) timescale, it seems to increase the synchrony (though the Gross index and wavelets provide slightly different answers). At even shorter timescales though, it seems to decrease it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More clear-cut results can be found when we examine the synchrony vs compensation between functional groups (Fig. 2d). Since we consider only two functional groups, the Gross index reduces to a simple correlation

While compensation could be expected upon visual inspection of the time series of the two groups formed by cormorant on the one hand, and egret plus heron (summed as a small functional group) on the other hand (Fig.

 that synchrony is in fact the rule around the annual scale and below, when considering the wavelet index. We wondered if the patterns in Fig. 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 were caused by the use of a log scale, but we found that in fact the correlation was higher rather than lower on the log scale (Appendix 2). However, over long temporal scales (
\begin_inset Formula $\sim$
\end_inset

 6 years) there seems to be some compensation, traducing a progressive change in composition within this small community module, that was already visible on the time series plot (Fig. 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Time-series-of"
plural "false"

\end_inset

). There might be some compensation over very short timescale as well (within the season), but at very specific times and the biological mechanisms for this are unclear, since these species compete for roost sites, a process that it unlikely to manifest at such very short timescales.

Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Compensation was overall very rare at the yearly timescale (differentiating between the cold and warm season). At short timescales (below the season), and among taxonomically or functionally close species, some compensation could be found but only at certain periods. In other words, there was no widespread

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yet, summing species abundances within a guild and comparing the

between

 guilds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given that we compare the level of synchrony/compensation within guilds (with many species) and between guilds (with only a handful of groups), we checked in Appendix 3 if changing the number of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

compartments
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

) in the Gross 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 index could affect its value: it did not. However, we found that if two groups respond in opposite ways to a shared driver, the stronger the response to the driver, the lesser the compensation indicated by 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 at the whole community level. This might explain the low levels of compensation that we found at the overall wetland bird community level (Appendix 1), in spite of the clear presence of two groups reacting in opposite way to shared driver (here, water levels). Analyses at several taxonomic/functional scales are therefore warranted to be conclusive about compensation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We used correlation between the summed abundances of closely related species (species within the 
\shape italic
Anas
\shape default
 genus vs species within the 
\shape italic
Calidris
\shape default
 genus) or the summed abundances of functionally similar species (waders vs ducks) to uncover compensation. The functional group classification produced much more clearly compensation between guilds than the taxonomic classification. We expected to see compensation at that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

functional scale
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 irrespective of the season, because the requirements of these birds are different, but here waders and ducks were found to correlate negatively only during the cold (wintering) season. This may be because the summer is characterized by a broad inflow of birds, including non-resident individuals that somehow add random variation to the community dynamics (though other explanations are possible).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It may be better to say that we detected

compensation

 rather than

 between bird species

\end_inset

 as the observed long-term changes in species composition (more waders, proportionally less ducks; Appendix 4) might be due to an increased inflow of birds preferring low water levels, and outflow of birds preferring high water levels, under an overall space constraint. In other words, the shift in community dynamics is likely not directly due to birth and deaths. However, despite the importance of movements and habitat preference to the local community dynamics, there is certainly also an influence of the regional changes in births and deaths on these local dynamics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zooming in on the cormorant-heron-egret module, we find that compensation mostly occurs above the annual temporal scale, and predominantly in summer as well as before 2006. This occurs because of a slow replacement of species due to competition for resting/roosting sites in the summer season (C. Feigné, pers. obs.), which mostly occurred before 2006.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall, our results suggest to search for compensation more often
\emph on
 between
\emph default
 rather than 
\emph on
within
\emph default
 functional groups, and over relatively long timescales above that of the dominant driver (e.g., above 5 years if the main driver is a seasonal climate). This goes against calls to search for compensation at very short timescales 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 in order to filter out the effect of the main seasonal driver. Although searching for compensation at temporal scales below the seasonal abiotic driver (e.g., temperature) was partly motivated by studies on plankton whose community dynamics are much faster, we could have expected compensation to manifest also that scale here as well (e.g., monthly). Movement of birds reacting to food availability can certainly occur that fast, and wetlands have a finite carrying capacity, which could promote short-term compensation. We suspect that instead, because many species share common abiotic drivers at short temporal scales

\end_inset

, compensation is bound to be quite rare below the dominant temporal scale of the environment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In many ways, searching for compensation using biodiversity time series data is searching for needles in a haystack: only some specific temporal and functional/taxonomic scales allow to see compensation whilst numerous confounding factors make the community co-vary positively at all other scales

. Although the knowledge of specific biological mechanisms increasing the densities of some species at the expense of others can help, synchrony will likely dominate community-level time series data for closely related species, even in species that compete strongly

. This is true even in cases of known mechanisms of competition or shifts in community composition due to abiotic changes as in this study. We suggest that

 taxonomically or functionally (considering summed abondances of dissimilar functional groups) and temporally (considering temporal scales well above the dominant driver) may often be the best strategy to see the compensation that will inevitably manifest if the community-level abundance is maintained within bounds.
