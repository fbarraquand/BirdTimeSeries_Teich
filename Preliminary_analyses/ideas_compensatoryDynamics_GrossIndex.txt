How to test the Gross index to see the dependent on the number of groups

- We could make two groups that react in a similar vs opposite manner to an abotic driver, with and without competition. Then we consider k=1,...,n species in each group, and look at how the Gross index varies with n. In their simulations with n=10 the Gross index seems to be able to take very low values with either strong competition or strong opposite response to the abiotic driver (or both). 

- Given what the Gross index is having values -1 for constant total biomass, we may want to compute the total biomass in our times series to see whether it fluctuates a little or a lot. We may also want to compute plot total wader vs total duck biomass for the two seasons, though I bet we have that somewhere. 

 - Scenarios in simulated vs real data could be compared on the basis of the CVs of total biomass vs CVs of constitutent species, as well as n(species).
