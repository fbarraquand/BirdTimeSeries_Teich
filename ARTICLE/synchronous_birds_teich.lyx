\begin_layout Title
Synchronous or compensatory community dynamics? Insights from a long-term
 bird study at multiple temporal and taxonomic scales
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ecological theory suggests that within rich communities where a number of
 species have similar functions, due to their proximity in morphological
 or phylogenetic space, they might exhibit compensatory dynamics

key "gonzalez2009causes"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, i.e., species within the same guild should swap places to some extent, whenever
 there is a space or resource constraint combined with temporal environmental
 variability.
 Which species

win
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 at any particular point in time may then depend on the fine-grained temporal
 environmental variation, or just on random exclusion processes (e.g., who
 gets there first).
 Whatever the cause of compensatory dynamics, its main consequences for
 ecosystem functioning is therefore that the community as a whole exhibits
 lower biomass variation than its constituent species (REFS), and is therefore
 more stable in the sense of lower variation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Early investigations of synchronous vs compensatory dynamics focused on
 the variance ratio, that is, the variance of the sum of the community biomass
 divided by the sum of the variance of the component species biomasses.
 Unfortunately, this approach is not appropriate for communities subjected
 to community-wide environmental forcing (REFs), because one main environmental
 driver (e.g., temperature or light) may synchronize all the species abundances
 or growth rates.
 Further research has therefore focused on specific timeframes where compensator
y dynamics may be found (e.g., below the seasonal scale where temperature
 fluctuation tends to synchronize species, Vasseur ref).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite this effort to make temporal scales more precise, temporal compensation
 has been surprinsingly elusive in the field (REFs)

.
 Most datasets used to evaluate temporal compensation vs synchrony involve
 planktonic organisms (REFs) or terrestrial plants ( ; though see).
 Here, we take advantage of a long-term bird time series record at the monthly
 scale (XX years), in a natural reserve, that allows us to dig deeper into
 patterns of synchrony between species at various time and taxonomic scales.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed, taxonomic scale should be a main modulator of synchrony/compensation,
 a factor of variation that has been somewhat negelected for now.
 On the one hand, one could argue that compensation should be higher between
 similar species, because functional and phylogenetic differences being
 generally correlated.
 If species A and B are two duck species that share almost the same food
 niche and share many traits, it makes little difference to the rest of
 the community whether one species gets replaced by the other (functional
 compensation,

\end_inset

).
 On the other hand, it could be argued as well that more dissimilar groups
 of species - within the same trophic level nonetheless - could exhibit
 compensation exactly because they have different environmental preferences
 and the environment varies (e.g., groups of species preferring more open
 vs more closed habitats replacing each other as a function of changes in
 vegetation height).
 Surprisingly, this aspect has been relatively less well explored even though
 there is some empirical evidence for this

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our dataset is ideally suited to tackle how synchronous are bird communities
 at different temporal and taxonomic scale given that (i) it is a highly
 temporally resolved time series with respect to the species typical generation
 times and (ii) the reserve where the data has been collected was subjected
 to a major management change c.
 2006 (change in water levels), favouring different types of wetland birds
 (so that over long timescales, there is a potential for changes in community
 composition).

Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The monthly time series used for the statistical analyses have been collected
 at the Teich Ornithological Reserve, Arcachon Bay, France ([coordinates
 here]).
 The reserve is constituted of XX ha of wetlands , and the data have been
 aggregated at the reserve scale by using for each species the maximum observed
 abundance over a month, which provide a

 of the bird community.
 In the statistical analyses, we use both the monthly data and aggregates
 at the seasonal scale.
 We defined two seasons in the following manner XXXX (see Appendix S1 for
 alternative choices of season definition).

Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Compensatory dynamics are still rare even a short frequencies among taxonomicall
y or functionally close species, i.e.
 there is no functional compensation.
 Yet, accross contrasted guilds can change in frequency in the long run
 (in this case, due a change in management).
 We therefore suggest that compensation should be searched for more often
 between rather within functional groups, and on relatively long timescales
 above that of the dominant driver (e.g., seasonality).
