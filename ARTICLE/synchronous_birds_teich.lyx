\begin_layout Abstract
Compensatory dynamics, during which community composition shifts despite
 a total community size that stays near constancy, are usually rare in natural
 communities.
 This is a puzzle for ecologists because of the key role of this phenomenon
 to explain the relation between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.
 Early studies suggested that this rarity may be due to the use of temporal
 scales at which a key abiotic driver such as temperature can synchronize
 the whole community.
 New ideas and techniques have then been put forward to look at compensation
 vs synchrony at varied temporal scales, which we apply here.
 We take advantage of a long-term wetland bird biodiversity time series
 of 35 years in a natural reserve, where we suspected that compensation
 might be frequent due to changes in water levels and known trends in some
 species.
 We find that compensatory dynamics are still rare, likely due to the synchroniz
ing influence of climate on birds, even after considering several temporal
 scales of covariation (during cold or warm seasons, above or below the
 season).
 Negative covariation in abundance at the community level did appear, however,
 but only after a management change in the reserve, and at the scale of
 a few months or several years.
 Although a lot of attention has been focused on temporal scale, we remark
 the potential for compensation to vary with taxonomic and functional scale
 too: we find that compensation appears more frequently between guilds rather
 than within guilds, and it does so at long temporal scales (several years).
 This suggests that, in contrast to suggestions to search for very fine
 grained compensation within communities, perhaps compensation has more
 potential to emerge between classes, families or broad functional groups,
 or within restricted sets of species that are known to compete.

We could present this in a more sexy way by saying that whilst some authors
 suggested to zoom in temporally and taxonomically to see compensation,
 this might instead by better seen by zooming out.

 Agreed.
 I would not necessarily end with compensation within sets of species that

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ecological theory suggests that within rich communities at the same trophic
 level, where a number of species can have similar functions due to their
 proximity in morphological or phylogenetic space, they might exhibit compensato
ry dynamics 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

.
 Compensation occurs when individual
\change_inserted -2100369821 1531916878
s
\change_unchanged
 of some species replace individuals of another species, either because
 of explicit competitive processes or shifts in some environmental driver
 that change selection pressures.
 This is particularly likely to occur when there is a space or resource
 constraint combined with temporal environmental variability.
 Which species 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

win
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 at any particular point in time may then depend on the fine-grained temporal
 environmental variation, or just on random exclusion processes (i.e., who
 gets there first).
 Whatever the cause of compensatory dynamics, its main consequences for
 ecosystem functioning is therefore that the community as a whole exhibits
 lower biomass variation than its constituent species 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gross2013species"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Compensation is therefore intertwined with community-level stability, at
 least when stability is understood as the reciprocal of variability.
 By contrast, another very frequent outcome on biodiversity time series
 is synchrony

\change_unchanged
.
 Synchrony occurs when all species fluctuate in phase, and therefore the
 biomass of the community may not fluctuate less than its constituent parts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Early investigations of the frequency of synchronous vs.
 compensatory dynamics focused on the variance ratio, that is, the variance
 of the sum of the community biomass divided by the sum of the variance
 of the component species biomasses 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "houlahan_compensatory_2007,gonzalez2009causes"

 Unfortunately, this metric is not appropriate for communities subjected
 to community-wide environmental forcing 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ranta_detecting_2008"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, because one main environmental driver (e.g., temperature or light) may synchroni
ze species abundances or growth rates at some scale, and yet the species
 could have strongly competitive dynamics.
 Further research has therefore focused on specific timeframes where compensator
y dynamics may be found (e.g., below the seasonal scale where temperature
 fluctuation tends to synchronize species,

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite this effort to look for more meaningful temporal scales, temporal
 compensation has been surprinsingly elusive in the field (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Most datasets used to evaluate temporal compensation vs synchrony involve
 planktonic organisms (Vasseur & Gaedke, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Here, we take advantage of a long-term bird time series record at the monthly
 scale (for 35 years

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

), in a natural reserve, that allows us to dig deeper into patterns of synchrony
 between species at several temporal and taxonomic or functional scales.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed, taxonomic scale should be a main modulator of synchrony/compensation,
 a factor of variation that has been somewhat neglected for now.
 On the one hand, one could argue that compensation should be higher between
 similar species, because functional and phylogenetic differences are generally
 correlated.
 For example, if species A and B are two duck species that share almost
 the same food niche as well as many traits, it makes little difference
 to the rest of the community whether one species gets replaced by the other
 (functional compensation, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gonzalez2009causes"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 On the other hand, it could be argued as well that the two ducks will precisely
 respond in similar ways to environmental variables and only exhibit competition
 at some specific times or places.
 Under this scenario, more dissimilar groups of species - within the same
 trophic level nonetheless - could exhibit compensation exactly because
 they have different environmental preferences and the environment varies
 over time (e.g., groups of species preferring more open vs more closed habitats
 replacing each other as a function of changes in vegetation height).
 Surprisingly, this aspect - compensation between guilds - has been less
 well explored, even though there is some empirical evidence for compensation
 between dissimilar guilds 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "sinclair2013asynchronous"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 We explore different ways to cluster the community, along either taxonomic
 or functional classifications.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our dataset is ideally suited to tackle how synchronous bird communities
 are at different temporal and taxonomic/functional scales given that (i)
 it is a highly temporally resolved time series with respect to the species
 typical generation times and (ii) the reserve where the data has been collected
 was subjected to a major management change c.
 2006 (change in water levels), favouring different types of wetland birds
 (so that over long timescales, there is a potential for changes in community
 composition).

Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The monthly time series used for the statistical analyses have been collected
 at the Teich Ornithological Reserve, Arcachon Bay, France (44.64°N / -1.02°E).
 The reserve is constituted of 120 ha of wetlands, and the data have been
 aggregated at the reserve scale by using for each species the maximum observed
 abundance over a month, which provides a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

monthly snapshot
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the bird community.
 In the statistical analyses, we use both the monthly data and aggregates
 at the seasonal scale.
 We defined two seasons based on observations of bird presence related to
 temperature.
 We defined the `cold season' as the months between November and February
 of the following year, and a `warm season', from May to August.
 From an ecological viewpoint, we separate wintering birds from summer residents
, as these two communities have different requirements and there is a large
 shift in composition (though winter and summer communities partially overlap
 due to a number of shared species).

 We also differentiated periods before and after 2006, given that a management

 I don't Bonferroni-correct for now.
 Thinking about it, wouldn't it be 5/(3*6*2) (3 periods of time, 6 groups,

 synchrony, suggests that there is synchrony even at a fine temporal scale
 throughout most of the time series.
 However, post-2006, there seems to be a possibility for overcompensation
 on a scale around 5 years or around 3-4 months.

There are therefore relatively contrasted results regarding the effect of
 the management change on synchrony within the wader community.
 At the yearly (season) timescale, it seems to increase the synchrony (though
 the Gross index and wavelets provide slightly different answers).
 At shorter timescales though, it seems to decrease it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More clear-cut can be found when we examine the synchrony vs.
 compensation between functional groups (Fig.
 2d).
 Since we consider only two functional groups, the Gross index is a simple
 correlation.
 Waders and ducks are negatively correlated during the cold season and positivel
y correlated during the warm season.
 The patterns are not clear using taxonomic classification (Fig.
 2c).

\begin_layout Standard
Compensation was very rare at the yearly timescale (differentiating between
 the cold and warm season).
 At short timescales (below the season) among taxonomically or functionally
 close species, some compensation could be found but only at certain periods.
 In other words, there was no widespread

 (sensu

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yet, across contrasted guilds, community composition can change in frequency
 in the long run.
 We used correlation between the summed abundances of closely related species
 (species within

 vs.
 ducks).
 The functional group classification was more relevant in this respect.
 We expected to see compensation at that

 irrespective of the season, but here waders and ducks correlate negatively
 only during the cold (wintering) season.
 This may be because the summer

seems
\change_inserted -2100369821 1531928803
is characterized by
\change_unchanged
 a broad inflow of birds including non-breeding individuals.
 It may be better to say that we detected

 as these changes (more waders, less ducks) might be due to an increase
 inflow of birds preferring low water levels and outflow of birds preferring
 high water levels, under an overall space constraint.
 In other words, the shift in community dynamics is likely not due to birth
 and deaths.
 However, we did not restrict compensation to near constant total biomass
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, we find that compensation mostly occurs above the annual temporal scale,
 and predominantly in summer as well as before 2006.
 This occurs because a long-term shift due to competition for resting sites
 in the summer season, which mostly occurred before 2006.
 We therefore suggest 
\change_deleted -2100369821 1531930561
that

,
\change_unchanged

 This goes against calls to search for compensation at very short timescales
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

: we suspect that because many species share common abiotic drivers at that
 scale 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, compensation is bound to
\change_inserted -2100369821 1531928933
 be
\change_unchanged
 very rare.
 Moreover, there are limits to how many species one can be negatively correlated
 with: looking for negative correlations between the summed abondances of
 a small number of guilds or a small number of species makes more sense.

In many ways, searching for compensation using biodiversity time series
 data is searching for needles in a haystack: only some specific temporal

.
 Although the knowledge of specific biological mechanisms increasing the
 densities of some species at the expense of others can help (here, a change
 in management favouring waders over ducks, competition for nests between
 cormorants and herons), synchrony will likely dominate community-level
 time series data.
 This is true even in cases of known competition or shifts in community
 composition due to abiotic changes as in this study.
