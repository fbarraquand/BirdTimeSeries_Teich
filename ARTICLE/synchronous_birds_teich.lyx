\begin_layout Abstract
Compensatory dynamics, during which community composition shifts despite
 a near-constant total community size, are usually rare: synchronous dynamics
 prevail in natural communities.
 This is a puzzle for ecologists, because of the key role of compensation
 to explain the relation between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.
 Early studies suggested that this rarity may be due to the use of temporal
 scales at which a key abiotic driver such as temperature can synchronize
 the whole community.
 New ideas and techniques have then been put forward to look at compensation
 vs synchrony at varied temporal scales, which we apply here.
 We take advantage of a long-term wetland bird biodiversity time series
 of 35 years in a natural reserve, where we suspected that compensation
 might occur due to changes in water levels and known trends in some species.
 We find that compensatory dynamics are still rare, likely due to the synchroniz
ing influence of climate on birds, even after considering several temporal
 scales of covariation (during cold or warm seasons, above or below the
 season).
 Negative covariation in abundance at the community level did appear, however,
 but only after a management change in the reserve, and at the scale of
 a few months or several years.
 Although a lot of attention has been focused on the temporal scale of compensat
ion, we remark the potential for compensation to vary with taxonomic and
 functional scale too: compensation appears here more frequently between
 guilds rather than within guilds, and it does so at long temporal scales
 (several years).
 This suggests that, in contrast to suggestions to search for very fine-grained
 compensation within communities, perhaps compensation has more potential
 to emerge between classes, families or broad functional groups.

We could present this in a more sexy way by saying that whilst some authors
 suggested to zoom in temporally and taxonomically to see compensation,
 this might instead by better seen by zooming out.
 Agreed.
 I would not necessarily end with compensation within sets of species that
 are

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ecological theory suggests that within rich communities at the same trophic
 level, where a number of species can have similar functions due to their
 proximity in morphological or phylogenetic space, they might exhibit compensato
ry dynamics 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gonzalez2009causes"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Compensation occurs when individuals of some species replace individuals
 of another species, either because of explicit competitive processes or
 shifts in some environmental driver that change selection pressures.
 This is particularly likely to occur when there is a space or resource
 constraint combined with temporal environmental variability.
 Which species 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

win
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 at any particular point in time may then depend on the fine-grained temporal
 environmental variation, or just on random exclusion processes (i.e., who
 gets there first).
 Whatever the cause of compensatory dynamics, its main consequences for
 ecosystem functioning is therefore that the community as a whole exhibits
 lower biomass variation than its constituent species 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gross2013species"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Compensation is therefore intertwined with community-level stability, at
 least when stability is understood as the reciprocal of variability.
 By contrast, another very frequent outcome on biodiversity time series
 is synchrony 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "bush_fourier_2017,usinowicz_temporal_2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Synchrony occurs when all species fluctuate in phase, and therefore the
 biomass of the community may not fluctuate less than its constituent parts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Early investigations of the frequency of synchronous vs.
 compensatory dynamics focused on the variance ratio, that is, the variance
 of the sum of the community biomass divided by the sum of the variance
 of the component species biomasses 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "houlahan_compensatory_2007,gonzalez2009causes"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Unfortunately, this metric is not appropriate for communities subjected
 to community-wide environmental forcing 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ranta_detecting_2008"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, because a main environmental driver (e.g., temperature or light) may synchronize
 species abundances or growth rates at some scale, creating large variance
 in community-wide biomass, in spite of strongly competitive dynamics.
 Further research has therefore focused on specific timeframes where compensator
y dynamics may be found (e.g., below the seasonal scale where temperature
 fluctuations tend to synchronize species dynamics, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "vasseur_synchronous_2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite this effort to look for more meaningful temporal scales in biodiversity
 time series, temporal compensation has remained surprinsingly elusive in
 the field (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "houlahan_compensatory_2007,vasseur_synchronous_2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, ; but see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ernest2008zero,christensen2018long"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Most datasets used so far to evaluate temporal compensation vs synchrony
 involve planktonic organisms ( 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "vasseur2007spectral,vasseur_synchronous_2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) or terrestrial plants (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "houlahan_compensatory_2007,gross2013species"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 ; though see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "bell_stability_2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 ).
 Here, we take advantage of a long-term bird time series record at the monthly
 scale (for 35 years
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Considering only the years used in our analysis.
 Otherwise, the dataset begins in 1973.
\end_layout

\end_inset

), in a natural reserve, that allows us to dig deeper into patterns of synchrony
 between species at several temporal and taxonomic or functional scales.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed, taxonomic scale should be a main modulator of synchrony/compensation,
 a
\change_deleted -666822487 1533140835
 factor of variation
\change_inserted -666822487 1533140840
n explanatory factor
\change_unchanged
 that has been somewhat neglected for now.
 On the one hand, one could argue that compensation should be higher between
 closely related species, because functional and phylogenetic differences
 are generally correlated.
 For example, if species A and B are two duck species that share almost
 the same food niche as well as many traits, it makes little difference
 to the rest of the community whether one species gets replaced by the other
 (functional compensation,
\emph on
 sensu
\emph default
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gonzalez2009causes"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), and priority effects could dominate.
 On the other hand, it could be argued that the two similar duck species
 will precisely respond in similar ways to environmental variables, and
 although they might compete, this might be visible in their dynamics only
 at some specific times or places.
 Under the latter scenario, more dissimilar species or groups of species
 - within the same trophic level nonetheless - could compensate each other
 within the whole community, exactly because they have different environmental
 preferences and the environment varies over time (e.g., groups of species
 preferring more open vs more closed habitats replacing each other as a
 function of changes in vegetation height).
 Surprisingly, this aspect - compensation between guilds - has been less
 well explored, even though there is some empirical evidence for compensation
 between dissimilar guilds 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "sinclair2013asynchronous"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 We therefore explore different ways to cluster the bird community, along
 either taxonomic or functional classifications.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our dataset is ideally suited to tackle how synchronous bird communities
 are at different temporal and taxonomic/functional scales given that (i)
 it is a highly temporally resolved time series with respect to the species
 typical generation times
\change_inserted -666822487 1533141141
, but it also extends well beyond these
\change_unchanged
 and (ii) the reserve where the data has been collected was subjected to
 a major management change c.
 2006 (change in water levels), favouring different types of wetland birds
 (so that over long timescales, there is a potential for changes in community
 composition

 We defined two seasons based on observations of bird presence
\change_deleted -666822487 1533141388

\change_unchanged
.
 We defined the `cold season' as the months between November and February
 of the following year, and a `warm season', from May to August.
 From an ecological viewpoint, this seasonal classification separates wintering
 birds from summer residents
\change_inserted -666822487 1533141412
 (some of whom are breeding)
\change_unchanged
.
 This makes sense biologically because the two communities have different
 requirements and respond differentially to abiotic drivers.

 We averaged monthly bird abundances, for each species, over the season

 We also differentiated periods before and after 2006, given that a management

 We considered both the synchrony inside a given group (e.g., among

Do we Bonferronni-correct? In this case, 5/16 for the 4 seasons? (4 groups/4
 season?)Do we add the equation for the p-value? Doesn't feel necessary
 to me but what do you think? We'll discuss for the Bonferroni, but that
 makes sense if we do it below? In any case we don't need to mention more
 here if we add the codes to the GitHub repo.
 I don't Bonferroni-correct for now.
 Thinking about it, wouldn't it be 5/(3*6*2) (3 periods of time, 6 groups,
 2 seasons) ? Bonferroni corrections might be too strong in this context,
 let's discuss that together.

 are always positive whenever significantly different from the null (no

This increase in synchrony after 2006 is matched by the functional group

 Using the functional group classification, we see that pre-2006, there
 was some compensation within the waders, though not very pronounced

Even though there is no widespread community-wide or genus-wide compensation

 synchrony, suggests that there is synchrony even at a fine temporal scale
 throughout most of the time series.
 However, post-2006, there seems to be a possibility for overcompensation
 on a scale around 5 years or around 3-4 months.

 However,
\change_inserted -666822487 1533142793
 
\change_unchanged
over long temporal scales (
\begin_inset Formula $\sim$

6 years) there seems to be some compensation, traducing a progressive change

 There might be some compensation over very short timescale as well (within

Compensation was

 At short timescales (below the season)
\change_inserted -666822487 1533142212
, and
\change_unchanged
 among taxonomically or functionally close species, some compensation could
 be found but only at certain periods.
 In other words, there was no widespread

 We used correlation between the summed abundances of closely related species

\begin_layout Standard

\change_inserted -666822487 1533143431
Given that we compare the level of synchrony/compensation within guilds
 (with many species) and between guilds (with a handful of groups), we checked
 in ESM 3 whether changing the number of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

compartments
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the Gross 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 index could affect its value: it did not.
 However, if two groups respond in opposite ways to a shared driver, we
 found nonetheless that the stronger the response to the driver, the lesser
 the compensation using 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 at the community level.
 This might explain the low levels of compensation that we found at the
 overall wetland bird community level (ESM 1), in spite of the presence
 of two groups reacting in opposite way to shared driver (here, water level).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The functional group classification produced 
\change_inserted -666822487 1533143006
much 
\change_unchanged
more clearly compensation
\change_inserted -666822487 1533142999
 between guilds than the taxonomic classification
\change_unchanged
.
 We expected to see compensation at that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

functional scale
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 irrespective of the season, 
\change_inserted -666822487 1533143041
because the requirements of these birds are different, 
\change_unchanged
but here waders and ducks were found to correlate negatively only during
 the cold (wintering) season.
 This may be because the summer is characterized by a broad inflow of birds,
 including non-resident individuals that somehow add random variation to
 the community dynamics (though other explanations are possible).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It may be better to say that we detected 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

compensation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 rather than 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

compensatory dynamics
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 between bird species 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gonzalez2009causes"

\end_inset

 as the observed long-term changes in species composition (more waders,
 less ducks) might be due to an increased inflow of birds preferring low
 water levels, and outflow of birds preferring high water levels, under
 an overall space constraint.
 In other words, the shift in community dynamics is likely not directly
 due to birth and deaths.
 However, despite the importance of movements and habitat preference to
 the local community dynamics, there is certainly also an influence of the
 regional changes in births and deaths on the local dynamics.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zooming in on the cormorant-heron-egret module, we find that compensation
 mostly occurs above the annual temporal scale, and predominantly in summer
 as well as before 2006.
 This occurs because of a long-term shift due to competition for resting/roostin
g sites in the summer season, which mostly occurred before 2006.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall, our results suggest to search for compensation more often
\emph on
 between
\emph default
 rather than 
\emph on
within
\emph default
 functional groups, and over relatively long timescales above that of the
 dominant driver (e.g., seasonality).
 This goes against calls to search for compensation at very short timescales

\change_inserted -666822487 1533142327
 in order to filter our the main seasonal driver
\change_unchanged
.
 Although searching for compensation at temporal scales below the seasonal
 abiotic driver (e.g., temperature) was partly motivated by studies on plankton
 whose community dynamics are much faster, we could have expected compensation
 to manifest also that scale here (e.g., monthly): movement of birds reacting
 to food availability can certainly occur that fast.
 We suspect instead that because many species share common abiotic drivers
 at short temporal scales 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, compensation is bound to be very rare below the dominant temporal scale

In many ways, searching for compensation using biodiversity time series

 Although the knowledge of specific biological mechanisms increasing the

 species, even in species that compete strongly

 This is true even in cases of known mechanisms of competition or shifts

 We suggest that

 taxonomically (considering summed abondances of dissimilar functional groups)
 and temporally (considering temporal scales well above the dominant driver)

 This compensation was seen on a log scale, and found conspicuous.
 We thus wondered if log-transforming the abundance would affect the values
