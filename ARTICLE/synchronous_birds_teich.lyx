\begin_layout Abstract
Compensatory dynamics, during which community composition shifts despite
 a total community size that stays near constancy, are usually rare
\change_inserted -666822487 1532257570
 and synchronous dynamics prevail
\change_unchanged
 in natural communities.
 This is a puzzle for ecologists because of the key role of this phenomenon
 to explain the relation between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.
 Early studies suggested that this rarity may be due to the use of temporal
 scales at which a key abiotic driver such as temperature can synchronize
 the whole community.
 New ideas and techniques have then been put forward to look at compensation
 vs synchrony at varied temporal scales, which we apply here.
 We take advantage of a long-term wetland bird biodiversity time series
 of 35 years in a natural reserve, where we suspected that compensation
 might be 
\change_deleted -666822487 1532257590
frequent 
\change_inserted -666822487 1532257592
possible 
\change_unchanged
due to changes in water levels and known trends in some species.
 We find that compensatory dynamics are still rare, likely due to the synchroniz
ing influence of climate on birds, even after considering several temporal
 scales of covariation (during cold or warm seasons, above or below the
 season).
 Negative covariation in abundance at the community level did appear, however,
 but only after a management change in the reserve, and at the scale of
 a few months or several years.
 Although a lot of attention has been focused on temporal scale, we remark
 the potential for compensation to vary with taxonomic and functional scale
 too: we find that compensation appears more frequently between guilds rather
 than within guilds, and it does so at long temporal scales (several years).
 This suggests that, in contrast to suggestions to search for very fine
 grained compensation within communities, perhaps compensation has more
 potential to emerge between classes, families or broad functional groups
\change_deleted -666822487 1532257617
, or within restricted sets of species that are known to compete

.

We could present this in a more sexy way by saying that whilst some authors
 suggested to zoom in temporally and taxonomically to see compensation,
 this might instead by better seen by zooming out.
 Agreed.
 I would not necessarily end with compensation within sets of species that
 are

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ecological theory suggests that within rich communities at the same trophic
 level, where a number of species can have similar functions due to their
 proximity in morphological or phylogenetic space, they might exhibit compensato
ry dynamics 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gonzalez2009causes"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Compensation occurs when individuals of some species replace individuals
 of another species, either because of explicit competitive processes or
 shifts in some environmental driver that change selection pressures.
 This is particularly likely to occur when there is a space or resource
 constraint combined with temporal environmental variability.
 Which species 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

win
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 at any particular point in time may then depend on the fine-grained temporal
 environmental variation, or just on random exclusion processes (i.e., who
 gets there first).
 Whatever the cause of compensatory dynamics, its main consequences for
 ecosystem functioning is therefore that the community as a whole exhibits
 lower biomass variation than its constituent species 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gross2013species"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Compensation is therefore intertwined with community-level stability, at
 least when stability is understood as the reciprocal of variability.
 By contrast, another very frequent outcome on biodiversity time series
 is synchrony 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "bush_fourier_2017,usinowicz_temporal_2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Synchrony occurs when all species fluctuate in phase, and therefore the
 biomass of the community may not fluctuate less than its constituent parts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Early investigations of the frequency of synchronous vs.
 compensatory dynamics focused on the variance ratio, that is, the variance
 of the sum of the community biomass divided by the sum of the variance
 of the component species biomasses 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "houlahan_compensatory_2007,gonzalez2009causes"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Unfortunately, this metric is not appropriate for communities subjected
 to community-wide environmental forcing 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ranta_detecting_2008"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, because one main environmental driver (e.g., temperature or light) may synchroni
ze species abundances or growth rates at some scale, and yet the species
 could have strongly competitive dynamics.
 Further research has therefore focused on specific timeframes where compensator
y dynamics may be found (e.g., below the seasonal scale where temperature
 fluctuation tends to synchronize species, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "vasseur_synchronous_2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite this effort to look for more meaningful temporal scales, temporal
 compensation has been surprinsingly elusive in the field (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "houlahan_compensatory_2007,vasseur_synchronous_2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, ; but see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ernest2008zero,christensen2018long"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Most datasets used to evaluate temporal compensation vs synchrony involve
 planktonic organisms ( 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "vasseur2007spectral,vasseur_synchronous_2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) or terrestrial plants (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "houlahan_compensatory_2007,gross2013species"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 ; though see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "bell_stability_2014"

\end_inset

 ).
 Here, we take advantage of a long-term bird time series record at the monthly
 scale (for 35 years
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Considering only the years used in our analysis.
 Otherwise, the dataset begins in 1973.
\end_layout

\end_inset

), in a natural reserve, that allows us to dig deeper into patterns of synchrony
 between species at several temporal and taxonomic or functional scales.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed, taxonomic scale should be a main modulator of synchrony/compensation,
 a factor of variation that has been somewhat neglected for now.
 On the one hand, one could argue that compensation should be higher between
 
\change_deleted -666822487 1532259775
similar
\change_inserted -666822487 1532259779
closely related
\change_unchanged
 species, because functional and phylogenetic differences are generally
 correlated.
 For example, if species A and B are two duck species that share almost
 the same food niche as well as many traits, it makes little difference
 to the rest of the community whether one species gets replaced by the other
 (functional compensation, 
\change_inserted -666822487 1532259811
sensu 
\change_unchanged

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gonzalez2009causes"

\end_inset

)
\change_inserted -666822487 1532259824
, and priority effects could dominate
\change_unchanged
.
 On the other hand, it could be argued as well that the two 
\change_inserted -666822487 1532259844
similar 
\change_unchanged
duck
\change_inserted -666822487 1532259847

s
\change_unchanged
 will precisely respond in similar ways to environmental variables
\change_inserted -666822487 1532259833
,
\change_unchanged
 and only exhibit competition at some specific times or places.
 Under th
\change_inserted -666822487 1532259862
e latter
\change_deleted -666822487 1532259861
is

 scenario, more dissimilar 
\change_deleted -666822487 1532259871
groups of 
\change_unchanged
species 
\change_inserted -666822487 1532259875
or groups 
\change_unchanged
- within the same trophic level nonetheless - could exhibit compensation
 exactly because they have different environmental preferences and the environme
nt varies over time (e.g., groups of species preferring more open vs more
 closed habitats replacing each other as a function of changes in vegetation
 height).
 Surprisingly, this aspect - compensation between guilds - has been less
 well explored, even though there is some empirical evidence for compensation
 between dissimilar guilds

.
 We 
\change_inserted -666822487 1532259889
therefore 
\change_unchanged
explore different ways to cluster the community, along either taxonomic
 or functional classifications.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our dataset is ideally suited to tackle how synchronous bird communities
 are at different temporal and taxonomic/functional scales given that (i)
 it is a highly temporally resolved time series with respect to the species
 typical generation times and (ii) the reserve where the data has been collected
 was subjected to a major management change c.
 2006 (change in water levels), favouring different types of wetland birds
 (so that over long timescales, there is a potential for changes in community
 composition).

Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The monthly time series used for the statistical analyses have been collected
 at the Teich Ornithological Reserve, Arcachon Bay, France (44.64°N / -1.02°E).
 The reserve is constituted of 120 ha of wetlands, and the data have been
 aggregated at the reserve scale by using for each species the maximum observed
 abundance over a month, which provides a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

monthly snapshot
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the bird community.
 In the statistical analyses, we use both the monthly data and aggregates
 at the seasonal scale.
 We defined two seasons based on observations of bird presence related to
 temperature.
 We defined the `cold season' as the months between November and February
 of the following year, and a `warm season', from May to August.
 From an ecological viewpoint, 
\change_deleted -666822487 1532259904
we

\change_deleted -666822487 1532259931
as these
\change_inserted -666822487 1532259938
This makes sense biologically because the

 two communities have different requirements
\change_inserted -666822487 1532260036
 and respond differentially to abiotic drivers., This also makes sense from
 a more statistical perspective, as

 there is a

 makes sense if we do it below? In any case we don't need to mention more
 here if we add the codes to the GitHub repo.
 I don't Bonferroni-correct for now.
 Thinking about it, wouldn't it be 5/(3*6*2) (3 periods of time, 6 groups,
 2 seasons) ? Bonferroni corrections might be too strong in this context,
 let's discuss that together.

Even though there is no widespread community-wide or genus-wide compensation

 a month or two, or broader scales, over several years.

 synchrony, suggests that there is synchrony even at a fine temporal scale
 throughout most of the time series.
 However, post-2006, there seems to be a possibility for overcompensation
 on a scale around 5 years or around 3-4 months.

There are therefore relatively contrasted results regarding the effect of
 the management change on synchrony within the wader community.
 At the yearly (season) timescale, it seems to increase the synchrony (though
 the Gross index and wavelets provide slightly different answers).
 At shorter timescales though, it seems to decrease it.

Compensation was very rare at the yearly timescale (differentiating between
 the cold and warm season).
 At short timescales (below the season) among taxonomically or functionally
 close species, some compensation could be found but only at certain periods.
 In other words, there was no widespread

Yet, summing species abundances and comparing the

 We used correlation between the summed abundances of closely related species

 The functional group classification produced more clearly compensation.
 We expected to see compensation at that

\change_inserted -666822487 1532261832

 Although searching for compensation at temporal scales below the seasonal

 taxonomically (considering summed abondances of dissimilar functional groups)
 and temporally (temporal scales above the dominant driver) may often be
 the best strategy to see the compensation that will inevitably manifest
 if the community-level abundance is maintained within bounds.

Gross' synchrony index as a function of the season (cold and warm seasons),
 calculated among the 60 most frequent species in the Teich reserve.
 The index was computed in each panel on the whole dataset (black) or using
 two periods: before and after 2006 (light and dark blue), the year of the
 change in water level management.
 Red stars correspond to synchrony values significantly different from the
 null model (independent species), at the 5% threshold.

Remark FB: I am wondering if the significant

 point here comes from the inclusion of the wader community? This is puzzling
 because in Fig 2B, it is the ducks that are significantly below zero.
 I see two options to explain these findings:

\change_inserted -666822487 1532262672
1 - We did not Bonferroni correct so these near zero correlations just pop
 up

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\change_inserted -666822487 1532262715
2 - Some other, very abundant species present in the 60 (freq) species that's
 neither wader nor ducks displays some negative covariation with the rest
 of the community.

Gross' synchrony index as a function of the season (cold and warm seasons),
 calculated on log-transformed abundance data for the two groups formed
 by cormorant and heron+egret.
 The index was computed in each panel on the whole dataset (black) or using
 two periods: before and after 2006 (light and dark blue), the year of the
 change in water level management.
 No value was deemed significant.

We noted on Fig.

 that cormorants, herons and egrets seemed to compensate each other, at
 least for the first period of the time series.
 This compensation was even more conspicuous on a log scale.
 We thus wondered if log-transforming the abundance would affect the values
 of the synchrony index observed for this group.
 It appears that synchrony values are higher with log-transformed abundances.
