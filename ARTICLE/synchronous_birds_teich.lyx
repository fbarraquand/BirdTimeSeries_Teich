Synchronous or compensatory community dynamics? Insights from a long-term
 bird study at multiple temporal and taxonomic scales

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ecological theory suggests that within rich communities
\change_inserted -666822487 1527518150
 at the same trophic level,
\change_unchanged
 where a number of species 
\change_inserted -666822487 1527518116
can 
\change_unchanged
have similar functions
\change_deleted -666822487 1527518120
,
\change_unchanged
 due to their proximity in morphological or phylogenetic space, they might
 exhibit compensatory dynamics 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gonzalez2009causes"

\end_inset

, i.e., species within the same guild 
\change_deleted -666822487 1527518171
should
\change_inserted -666822487 1527518171
can
\change_unchanged
 swap places to some extent
\change_deleted -666822487 1527518177
, whenever
\change_inserted -666822487 1527518187
.
 This is particularly likely to occur when
\change_unchanged
 there is a space or resource constraint combined with temporal environmental
 variability.
 Which species 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

win
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 at any particular point in time may then depend on the fine-grained temporal
 environmental variation, or just on random exclusion processes (e.g., who
 gets there first).
 Whatever the cause of compensatory dynamics, its main consequences for
 ecosystem functioning is therefore that the community as a whole exhibits
 lower biomass variation than its constituent species (REFS), and is therefore
 more stable in the sense of 
\change_inserted -666822487 1527518246
having 
\change_unchanged
lower 
\change_deleted -666822487 1527518232
variation
\change_inserted -666822487 1527518253
temporal variability
\change_unchanged
.
 
\change_inserted -666822487 1527518306
By contrast, synchrony occurs when all species fluctuate in phase, and therefore
 the biomass of the community does not fluctuate less than its constituent
 parts.
 
\change_unchanged

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Early investigations of synchronous vs compensatory dynamics focused on
 the variance ratio, that is, the variance of the sum of the community biomass
 divided by the sum of the variance of the component species biomasses.
 Unfortunately, this approach is not appropriate for communities subjected
 to community-wide environmental forcing (
\change_deleted -666822487 1527518324
REFs)
\change_inserted -666822487 1527518329
Ranta et al.)
\change_unchanged
, because one main environmental driver (e.g., temperature or light) may synchroni
ze 
\change_deleted -666822487 1527518344
all the 
\change_unchanged
species abundances or growth rates.
 Further research has therefore focused on specific timeframes where compensator
y dynamics may be found (e.g., below the seasonal scale where temperature
 fluctuation tends to synchronize species, Vasseur

Despite this effort to 
\change_inserted -666822487 1527518370

\change_deleted -666822487 1527518374
make temporal scales more precise
\change_inserted -666822487 1527518383

\change_unchanged

 Most datasets used to evaluate temporal compensation vs synchrony involve
 planktonic organisms (REFs) or terrestrial plants ( ; though see).
 Here, we take advantage of a long-term bird time series record at the monthly

and taxonomic scales.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed, taxonomic scale should be a main modulator of synchrony/compensation,
 a factor of variation that has been somewhat negelected for now.
 On the one hand, one could argue that compensation should be higher between
 similar species, because functional and phylogenetic differences 
\change_deleted -666822487 1527518445
being
\change_inserted -666822487 1527518445
are
\change_unchanged
 generally correlated.
 
\change_inserted -666822487 1527518456
For example, i
\change_deleted -666822487 1527518455
I
\change_unchanged
f species A and B are two duck species that share almost the same food niche
 
\change_deleted -666822487 1527518464
and share 
\change_inserted -666822487 1527518467
as well as 
\change_unchanged
many traits, it makes little difference to the rest of the community whether
 one species gets replaced by the other (functional compensation, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

).
 On the other hand, it could be argued as well that more dissimilar groups
 of species - within the same trophic level nonetheless - could exhibit
 compensation exactly because they have different environmental preferences
 and the environment varies (e.g., groups of species preferring more open
 vs more closed habitats replacing each other as a function of changes in
 vegetation height).
 Surprisingly, this aspect has been 
\change_deleted -666822487 1527518506
relatively 
\change_unchanged
less well explored

Our dataset is ideally suited to tackle how synchronous are bird communities

 In the statistical analyses, we use both the monthly data and aggregates
 at the seasonal scale.
 We defined two seasons
\change_inserted -2100369821 1531144014
 based on observations of bird presence related to temperature.
 We defined a 'cold season' as the months between November and February
 of the following year, and a 'warm season', from May to August.
 This makes sense from an ecological viewpoint, as we separate wintering
 birds from summer residents, and these two communities have different needs
 and a shifting composition (though they partially overlap).

 is the modulus of the complex number.
 The numerator corresponds to the total biomass variation while the denominator
 corresponds to the variations of each species.
 This index is close to 0 when species compensate and reaches 1 when they
 are synchronous.
 As before, the significance of each value was tested at the 5%, Bonferroni-corr
ected, threshold by 100 phase-randomizations of each species time series,
 and computation of the corresponding

Using a taxonomic classification (Calidris and Anas), we can see that within-gen
us synchrony indices are always positive, i.e.
 there is no compensation within a genus (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Gross-synchrony-index"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The synchrony tend to be lower during the cold season, and to be lower
 during the pre-2006 period as well (during which water levels were higher).
 These changes are somewhat matched by the functional classification, for
 waders at least.

\begin_layout Standard

\change_inserted -666822487 1527521432
Even though there is no community-wide or genus-wide compensation using
 the year (differentiating the seasons) as the baseline temporal unit, there
 could be compensation at finer temporal scales, e.g.
 a month or two, or larger, over several years.
 The wavelet plot (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Wavelet-modulus-ratio"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), that allows to consider a time-varying strength of synchrony vs.
 compensation, suggests that there is synchrony even at a fine temporal
 scale throughout most of the time series.
 However, post-2006, there seems to be a possibility for overcompensation
 on a scale around 5 years or around 3-4 months.

We also need to contrast Sum(Calidris) vs Sum(Anas).
 Also Sum(Waders) vs Sum(all the rest).
 We have to discuss this some more.
 It would be best to do another figure.

 including waders...

\change_inserted -2100369821 1530709338
 Changed it.
 Now, it is frequent birds without waders.
 Bottom is ducks, not frequent birds ; and I'm wondering if we should also
 show the synchrony inside the duck group instead of the synchrony inside
 the frequent bird groups

We therefore suggest that compensation should be searched for more often
 between rather within functional groups, and on relatively long timescales
 above that of the dominant driver (e.g., seasonality).
