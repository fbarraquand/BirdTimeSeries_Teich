\begin_layout Abstract
Compensatory dynamics, during which community composition shifts despite
 a near-constant total community size, are usually rare: synchronous dynamics
 prevail in natural communities.
 This is a puzzle for ecologists, because of the key role of compensation
 to explain the relation between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.
 Early studies suggested that this rarity may be due to the use of temporal
 scales at which a key abiotic driver such as temperature can synchronize
 the whole community.
 New ideas and techniques have then been put forward to look at compensation
 vs synchrony at varied temporal scales, which we apply here.
 We take advantage of a long-term wetland bird biodiversity time series
 of 35 years in a natural reserve, where we suspected that compensation
 might occur due to changes in water levels and known trends in some species.
 We find that compensatory dynamics are still rare, likely due to the synchroniz
ing influence of climate on birds, even after considering several temporal
 scales of covariation (during cold or warm seasons, above or below the
 seasonal scale).
 Negative covariation in abundance at the whole community level did only
 appear after a management change in the reserve, and at the scale of a
 few months or several years.
 Although a lot of attention has been focused on the temporal scale of compensat
ion, we remarked the potential for compensation to vary with taxonomic and
 functional scale too: compensation appeared here more frequently between
 guilds rather than within guilds, and it did so at long temporal scales
 (several years).
 This suggests that, in contrast to suggestions to search for very fine-grained
 compensation within communities organised as species list, perhaps compensation
 has more potential to emerge between classes, families or broad functional
 groups.

We could present this in a more sexy way by saying that whilst some authors
 suggested to zoom in temporally and taxonomically to see compensation,
 this might instead by better seen by zooming out.
 Agreed.
 I would not necessarily end with compensation within sets of species that
 are

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ecological theory suggests that within rich communities at the same trophic
 level, where a number of species can have similar functions due to their
 proximity in morphological or phylogenetic space, they might exhibit compensato
ry dynamics 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gonzalez2009causes"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Compensation occurs when individuals of some species replace individuals
 of 
\change_deleted -666822487 1533363848
an
\change_unchanged
other species, either because of explicit competitive processes or shifts
 in some environmental driver that change selection pressures.
 This is particularly likely to occur when there is a space or resource
 constraint combined with temporal environmental variability.
 Which species 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

win
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 at any particular point in time may then depend on the fine-grained temporal
 environmental variation, or just on 
\change_deleted -666822487 1533363862
random exclusion processes
\change_inserted -666822487 1533363866
priority effects
\change_unchanged
 (i.e., who gets there first).
 Whatever the cause of compensatory dynamics, its main consequences for
 ecosystem functioning is therefore that the community as a whole exhibits
 lower biomass variation than its constituent species 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gross2013species"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Compensation is therefore intertwined with community-level stability, at
 least when stability is understood as the reciprocal of variability.
 By contrast, another very frequent 
\change_inserted -666822487 1533363948
observed 
\change_unchanged
outcome on biodiversity time series is synchrony 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "bush_fourier_2017,usinowicz_temporal_2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Synchrony occurs when all species fluctuate in phase, and therefore the
 biomass of the community may not fluctuate less than its constituent parts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Early investigations of the frequency of synchronous vs.
 compensatory dynamics focused on the variance ratio, that is, the variance
 of the sum of the community biomass divided by the sum of the variance
 of the component species biomasses 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "houlahan_compensatory_2007,gonzalez2009causes"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Unfortunately, this metric is not appropriate for communities subjected
 to community-wide environmental forcing 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ranta_detecting_2008"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, because a main environmental driver (e.g., temperature or light) may synchronize
 species abundances or growth rates at some scale, creating large variance
 in community-wide biomass, in spite of strongly competitive dynamics.
 Further research has therefore focused on specific timeframes where compensator
y dynamics may be found (e.g., below the seasonal scale where temperature
 fluctuations tend to synchronize species dynamics, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "vasseur_synchronous_2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite this effort to look for more meaningful temporal scales in biodiversity
 time series, temporal compensation has remained surprinsingly elusive in
 the field (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "houlahan_compensatory_2007,vasseur_synchronous_2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

; but see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ernest2008zero,christensen2018long"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Most datasets used so far to evaluate temporal compensation vs synchrony
 involve planktonic organisms ( 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "vasseur2007spectral,vasseur_synchronous_2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) or terrestrial plants (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "houlahan_compensatory_2007,gross2013species"
literal "false"

\end_inset

; though see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "bell_stability_2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 ).
 Here, we take advantage of a long-term bird time series record at the monthly
 scale (for 35 years
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Considering only the years used in our analysis.
 Otherwise, the dataset begins in 1973.
\end_layout

\end_inset

), in a natural reserve, that allows us to dig deeper into patterns of synchrony
 between species at several temporal and taxonomic or functional scales.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed, taxonomic scale should be a main modulator of synchrony/compensation,
 a
\change_deleted -666822487 1533140835
 factor of variation
\change_inserted -666822487 1533140840
n explanatory factor
\change_unchanged
 that has been somewhat neglected for now.
 On the one hand, one could argue that compensation should be higher between
 closely related species, because functional and phylogenetic differences
 are generally correlated.
 For example, if species A and B are two duck species that share almost
 the same food niche as well as many traits, it makes little difference
 to the rest of the community whether one species gets replaced by the other
 (functional compensation,
\emph on
 sensu
\emph default
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gonzalez2009causes"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), and priority effects could dominate.
 On the other hand, it could be argued that the
\change_inserted -666822487 1533364054
se
\change_unchanged
 two similar duck species will precisely respond in similar ways to environmenta
l variables,
\change_inserted -666822487 1533364093
 which tends to obfuscate compensation
\change_deleted -666822487 1533364083
 and although they might compete, this might be visible in their dynamics
 only at some specific times or places
\change_unchanged
.
 Under the latter scenario, more dissimilar species or groups of species
 - within the same trophic level nonetheless - could compensate each other
 within the whole community, 
\change_deleted -666822487 1533364185
exactly
\change_inserted -666822487 1533364187
precisely
\change_unchanged
 because they have different environmental preferences and the environment
 varies over time (e.g., groups of species preferring more open vs more closed
 habitats replacing each other as a function of changes in vegetation height).
 Surprisingly,
\change_deleted -666822487 1533364219
 this aspect - 
\change_unchanged
compensation between guilds
\change_deleted -666822487 1533364233
 -
\change_unchanged
 has been less well explored
\change_inserted -666822487 1533364260
 than within guilds
\change_unchanged
, even though there is
\change_inserted -666822487 1533364266
 actually
\change_unchanged
 some empirical evidence for compensation between dissimilar guilds 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "sinclair2013asynchronous"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 We therefore explore different ways to cluster the bird community, 
\change_inserted -666822487 1533364292
within or between guilds, 
\change_unchanged
along either taxonomic or functional classifications.

\begin_layout Standard
Our dataset is ideally suited to tackle how synchronous
\change_inserted -666822487 1533364335

 bird communities are at different temporal and taxonomic/functional scales
 given that (i) it is a highly temporally resolved time series with respect

\change_inserted -666822487 1533364316

\change_unchanged
 and (ii) the reserve where the data has been collected was subjected to
 a major management change c.
 2006 (change in water levels), favouring different types of wetland birds
 (so that over long timescales, there is a

Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The monthly time series used for the statistical analyses have been collected
 at the Teich Ornithological Reserve, Arcachon Bay, France (44.64°N / -1.02°E)
\change_inserted -666822487 1533141218
, by the staff of the Teich reserve
\change_unchanged
.
 The reserve 
\change_deleted -666822487 1533141312
is constituted of
\change_inserted -666822487 1533141313
comprises
\change_unchanged
 120 ha of wetlands, and the data have been aggregated at the reserve scale
\change_inserted -666822487 1533141332
.
 
\change_deleted -666822487 1533141335
 by using
\change_inserted -666822487 1533141336
We use
\change_unchanged
 for each species the maximum observed abundance over a month, which provides
 a

abundance
\change_deleted -666822487 1533141359

\change_unchanged
.
 In the statistical analyses, we use both the 
\change_inserted -666822487 1533141371
original 
\change_unchanged
monthly data and aggregates at the seasonal scale.
 We defined two seasons based on observations of bird presence
\change_deleted -666822487 1533141388
 related to temperature
\change_unchanged
.
 We defined the `cold season' as the months between November and February
 of the following year, and a `warm season', from May to August.
 From an ecological viewpoint, this seasonal classification separates wintering
 birds from summer residents
\change_inserted -666822487 1533141412
 (some of whom are breeding)
\change_unchanged
.
 This makes sense biologically because the two communities have different
 requirements and respond differentially to abiotic drivers.

Do we Bonferronni-correct? In this case, 5/16 for the 4 seasons? (4 groups/4
 season?)Do we add the equation for the p-value? Doesn't feel necessary
 to me but what do you think? We'll discuss for the Bonferroni, but that
 makes sense if we do it below? In any case we don't need to mention more
 here if we add the codes to the GitHub repo.
 I don't Bonferroni-correct for now.
 Thinking about it, wouldn't it be 5/(3*6*2) (3 periods of time, 6 groups,
 2 seasons) ? Bonferroni corrections might be too strong in this context,
 let's discuss that together.

 are always positive whenever significantly different from the null (no

 Using the functional group classification, we see that pre-2006, there
 was some compensation within the waders, though not very pronounced

 synchrony, suggests that there is synchrony even at a fine temporal scale
 throughout most of the time series.
 However, post-2006, there seems to be a possibility for overcompensation
 on a scale around 5 years or around 3-4 months.

\change_unchanged

 However, over long temporal scales (
\begin_inset Formula $\sim$

 6 years) there seems to be some compensation, traducing a progressive change
 in composition within this small community module, that was already visible

 There might be some compensation over very short timescale as well (within

 this are unclear since these species compete for roost sites, a process
 that it unlikely to manifest at such very short timescales.

Given that we compare the level of synchrony/compensation within guilds
 (with many species) and between guilds (with only a handful of groups),
 we checked in ESM 3 whether changing the number of

compartments
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

) in the Gross 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$

 index could affect its value: it did not.
 However, we found that if two groups respond in opposite ways to a shared
 driver, the stronger the response to the driver, the lesser the compensation
 indicated by 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 at the whole community level.
 This might explain the low levels of compensation that we found at the
 overall wetland bird community level (ESM 1), in spite of the clear presence
 of two groups reacting in opposite way to shared driver (here, water levels).
 Analyses at several taxonomic/functional scales are therefore warranted
 to be conclusive about compensation.

\begin_layout Standard
The functional group classification produced

much

 We expected to see compensation at that

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 irrespective of the season, 
\change_inserted -666822487 1533143041
because the requirements of these birds are different, 
\change_unchanged
but here waders and ducks were found to correlate negatively only during
 the cold (wintering) season.
 This may be because the summer is characterized by a broad inflow of birds,
 including non-resident individuals that somehow add random variation to
 the community dynamics (though other explanations are possible).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It may be better to say that we detected

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

 as the observed long-term changes in species composition (more waders,
 less ducks) might be due to an increased inflow of birds preferring low
 water levels, and outflow of birds preferring high water levels, under
 an overall space constraint.
 In other words, the shift in community dynamics is likely not directly
 due to birth and deaths.
 However, despite the importance of movements and habitat preference to
 the local community dynamics, there is certainly also an influence of the
 regional changes in births and deaths on the

 local dynamics.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zooming in on the cormorant-heron-egret module, we find that compensation
 mostly occurs above the annual temporal scale, and predominantly in summer
 as well as before 2006.
 This occurs because of a long-term shift due to competition for resting/roostin
g sites in the summer season, which mostly occurred before 2006.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall, our results suggest to search for compensation more often
\emph on
 between
\emph default
 rather than 
\emph on
within
\emph default
 functional groups, and over relatively long timescales above that of the
 dominant driver (e.g., above 5 years if the main driver is a seasonal climate).
 This goes against calls to search for compensation at very short timescales

 This is true even in cases of known mechanisms of competition or shifts
 in community composition due to abiotic changes as in this study.
 We suggest that

 taxonomically (considering summed abondances of dissimilar functional groups)
 and temporally (considering temporal scales well above the dominant driver)
 may often be the best strategy to see the compensation that will inevitably
 manifest if the community-level abundance is maintained within bounds.

We noted on Fig.

 that cormorants, herons and egrets seemed to compensate each other, at
 least for the first period of the time series.
 This compensation was seen on a log scale, and 
\change_deleted -666822487 1533365751
found
\change_inserted -666822487 1533365752
seemed

 conspicuous
\change_inserted -666822487 1533365757
 on that scale
\change_unchanged
.
 We thus wondered if log-transforming the abundance would affect the values
 of the synchrony index observed for this group, and make compensation more
 likely.
 It appears to be the reverse: synchrony values are higher with log-transformed
 abundances.

), if we consider two groups which have opposite reactions to the same driver,
 the Gross index is not sensitive to the length of the time series or to
 the number of species in the community.
 For larger communities (over 10 species), synchrony is higher when the
 response to the driver is stronger.
 For our data, this means that the more birds are sensitive to the water
 level, the less we can expect compensation at the whole community level.
