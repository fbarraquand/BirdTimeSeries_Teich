\begin_layout Title
Synchronous or compensatory community dynamics? Insights from a long-term
 bird study at multiple temporal and taxonomic scales
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ecological theory suggests that within rich communities at the same trophic
 level, where a number of species can have similar functions due to their
 proximity in morphological or phylogenetic space, they might exhibit compensato
ry dynamics 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gonzalez2009causes"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, i.e., species within the same guild can swap places to some extent.
 This is particularly likely to occur when there is a space or resource
 constraint combined with temporal environmental variability.
 Which species 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

win
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 at any particular point in time may then depend on the fine-grained temporal
 environmental variation, or just on random exclusion processes (e.g., who
 gets there first).
 Whatever the cause of compensatory dynamics, its main consequences for
 ecosystem functioning is therefore that the community as a whole exhibits
 lower biomass variation than its constituent species (REFS), and is therefore
 more stable in the sense of having lower temporal variability.
 By contrast, synchrony occurs when all species fluctuate in phase, and
 therefore the biomass of the community does not fluctuate less than its
 constituent parts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Early investigations of synchronous vs compensatory dynamics focused on
 the variance ratio, that is, the variance of the sum of the community biomass
 divided by the sum of the variance of the component species biomasses.
 Unfortunately, this approach is not appropriate for communities subjected
 to community-wide environmental forcing (Ranta et al.), because one main
 environmental driver (e.g., temperature or light) may synchronize species
 abundances or growth rates.
 Further research has therefore focused on specific timeframes where compensator
y dynamics may be found (e.g., below the seasonal scale where temperature
 fluctuation tends to synchronize species, Vasseur 2014 ref).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite this effort to look for more meaningful temporal scales, temporal
 compensation has been surprinsingly elusive in the field (REFs)

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

.
 Most datasets used to evaluate temporal compensation vs synchrony involve
 planktonic organisms (REFs) or terrestrial plants ( ; though see).
 Here, we take advantage of a long-term bird time series record at the monthly
 scale (for 35 years
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
If we consider only the years we use.
 Otherwise, the dataset begins in 1973
\end_layout

\end_inset

), in a natural reserve, that allows us to dig deeper into patterns of synchrony
 between species at several temporal and taxonomic scales.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed, taxonomic scale should be a main modulator of synchrony/compensation,
 a factor of variation that has been somewhat negelected for now.
 On the one hand, one could argue that compensation should be higher between
 similar species, because functional and phylogenetic differences are generally
 correlated.
 For example, if species A and B are two duck species that share almost
 the same food niche as well as many traits, it makes little difference
 to the rest of the community whether one species gets replaced by the other
 (functional compensation, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gonzalez2009causes"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 On the other hand, it could be argued as well that more dissimilar groups
 of species - within the same trophic level nonetheless - could exhibit
 compensation exactly because they have different environmental preferences
 and the environment varies (e.g., groups of species preferring more open
 vs more closed habitats replacing each other as a function of changes in
 vegetation height).
 Surprisingly, this aspect has been less well explored, even though there
 is some empirical evidence for this

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our dataset is ideally suited to tackle how synchronous are bird communities
 at different temporal and taxonomic scale given that (i) it is a highly
 temporally resolved time series with respect to the species typical generation
 times and (ii) the reserve where the data has been collected was subjected
 to a major management change c.
 2006 (change in water levels), favouring different types of wetland birds
 (so that over long timescales, there is a potential for changes in community
 composition).

Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The monthly time series used for the statistical analyses have been collected
 at the Teich Ornithological Reserve, Arcachon Bay, France (44.64°N / -1.02°E).
 The reserve is constituted of 120 ha of wetlands, and the data have been
 aggregated at the reserve scale by using for each species the maximum observed
 abundance over a month, which provides a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

monthly snapshot
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the bird community.
 In the statistical analyses, we use both the monthly data and aggregates
 at the seasonal scale.
 We defined two seasons based on observations of bird presence related to
 temperature.
 We defined a 'cold season' as the months between November and February
 of the following year, and a 'warm season', from May to August.
 This makes sense from an ecological viewpoint, as we separate wintering
 birds from summer residents, and these two communities have different needs
 and a shifting composition (though they partially overlap).
 (see Appendix S1 for alternative choices of season definition).

 Contrary to previous indices (see, for instance, Loreau and de Mazancourt

 We averaged monthly bird abundances, for each species, over the season
 duration, and computed the synchrony index using the year as our statistical
 unit.
 We also differentiated before and after 2006, given that a management change
 occurred within the reserve in 2006.
 We considered both the synchrony inside a given group (e.g., among

Using a taxonomic classification (Calidris and Anas), we can see that within-gen
us synchrony indices
\change_inserted -666822487 1531328080
 at the seasonal scale
\change_unchanged
 are always positive whenever significantly different from the null (no
 temporal correlation between species), i.e.
 there is no compensation within a genus (Fig.

\change_inserted -666822487 1531328260
For the cold season, Calidris and Anas exhibit opposite trends in synchrony
 in response to the managment change in 2006, but these are not statistically
 significant.
 However, for the warm season, the management change, which consisted in
 lowering the water levels, creates more synchronous communities of species
 within the

\change_inserted -666822487 1531328408
This increase in synchrony after 2006 is matched by the functional group
 classification.
 Using the functional group classification, we see that pre-2006, there
 was some compensation within the waders, though not very pronounced.

 However, post-2006, there seems to be a possibility for overcompensation

There is therefore relatively contrasted results regarding the effect of
 the management change on synchrony within the wader community.
 At the yearly (season) timescale, it seems to increase the synchrony (though
 the Gross index and wavelets provide slightly different answers).
 At shorter timescales though, it seems to increase it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\change_inserted -666822487 1531329169
More clear-cut can be found when we examine the synchrony vs.
 compensation between functional groups (Fig.
 2d [ADD LABELS to multipanel figures]).
 Since we consider only two functional groups, the Gross index is a simple
 correlation.
 Waders and ducks are negatively correlated during the cold season and positivel
y correlated during the warm season.
 The patterns are not clear using taxonomic classification (Fig.

Fig.
 5 demonstrates that synchrony between shags and Egret+ Heron is the rule,
 but over long temporal scales [~6 years) there seems to be some compensation,
 traducing a progressive change within the community.
 There might be some compensation over very short timescale as well (within
 the season), but this is less clear and the biological mechanisms for this
 are unclear since these species compete through nesting (which usually
 occurs throughout the season).

Compensation is very rare at the yearly (differentiating the season) timescale

Compensatory dynamics are still rare

In other words, 
\change_deleted -666822487 1531329280
i.e.

\change_unchanged
 there is no functional compensation.
 Yet, across contrasted guilds, community composition can change in frequency
 in the long run
\change_deleted -666822487 1531329352
 (in this case, due a change in management)
\change_inserted -666822487 1531329615
.
 We used correlation between the summed abundances of closely related species
 (species within Anas genys vs.
 species within the Calidris genus) or the summed abundances of functionally
 similar species (waders vs.
 ducks).
 The functional group classification was more relevant in this respect.
 We expected to see compensation at that

functional scale
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 irrespective of the season, but here waders and ducks correlate negatively
 only during the cold (wintering) season.
 This may be because the summer seems a broad inflow of birds including
 non-breeding individuals.

Looking at shags vs heron + egret, we find that compensation only occurs
 at the largest temporal scales.

We therefore suggest that compensation should be searched for more often
 between rather within functional groups, and on relatively long timescales
 above that of the dominant driver (e.g., seasonality).

In many ways, searching for compensation using biodiversity time series
 data is searching for needles in a haystack: only some specific temporal
 and functional/taxonomic scales allow to see compensation whilst numerous
 confounding factors make the community co-vary positively at all other
 scales.
 We therefore that although the knowledge of specific biological mechanisms
 can help (here, a change in management favouring waders over ducks, competition
 for nests between shags and herons), synchrony will dominate community-level
 time series data even in cases of known competition or shifts in community
 composition due to changes in niches.
