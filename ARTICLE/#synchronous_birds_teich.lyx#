\begin_layout Abstract
Compensatory dynamics, during which community composition shifts despite
 a near-constant total community size, are usually rare: synchronous dynamics
 prevail in natural communities.
 This is a puzzle for ecologists, because of the key role of compensation
 to explain the relation between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.
 Early studies suggested that this rarity may be due to the use of temporal
 scales at which a key abiotic driver such as temperature can synchronize
 the whole community.
 New ideas and techniques have then been put forward to look at compensation
 vs synchrony at varied temporal scales, which we apply here.
 We take advantage of a long-term wetland bird community time series of
 35 years in a natural reserve, where we suspected that compensation might
 occur due to changes in water levels and known trends in some species.
 We find that compensatory dynamics are still rare, likely due to the synchroniz
ing influence of climate on birds, even after considering several temporal
 scales of covariation (during cold or warm seasons, above or below the
 seasonal scale).
 Negative covariation in abundance at the whole community level did only
 appear after a management change in the reserve, and at the scale of a
 few months or several years.
 Although a lot of attention has been focused on the temporal scale of compensat
ion, we remarked the potential for compensation to vary with taxonomic and
 functional scale too: compensation appeared here more frequently between
 guilds rather than within guilds, and it did so at long temporal scales
 (several years).
 This suggests that, in contrast to suggestions to search for very fine-grained
 compensation within communities organised as species list, perhaps compensation
 has more potential to emerge between classes, families or broad functional
 groups.

We could present this in a more sexy way by saying that whilst some authors
 suggested to zoom in temporally and taxonomically to see compensation,
 this might instead by better seen by zooming out.
 Agreed.
 I would not necessarily end with compensation within sets of species that
 are

, the link between competition and compensation is not that clear (even

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ecological theory suggests that within rich communities, where a number
 of species can have similar functions due to their proximity in morphological
 or phylogenetic space, they might exhibit compensatory dynamics 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gonzalez2009causes"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Compensation occurs when individuals of some species replace individuals
 of other species, either because of explicit competitive processes or shifts
 in some environmental driver that change selection pressures.
 This is particularly likely to occur when there is a space or resource
 constraint combined with temporal environmental variability.
 Which species 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

win
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 at any particular point in time may then depend on the fine-grained temporal
 environmental variation, or just on priority effects (i.e., who gets there
 first).
 Whatever the cause of compensatory dynamics, its main consequences for
 ecosystem functioning is that the community as a whole exhibits lower biomass
 variation than its constituent species 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gross2013species"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Compensation is therefore intertwined with community-level stability, at
 least when stability is understood as the reciprocal of variability.
 By contrast, another very frequent observed outcome on biodiversity time
 series is synchrony 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "bush_fourier_2017,usinowicz_temporal_2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Synchrony occurs when all species fluctuate in phase, and therefore the
 biomass of the community may not fluctuate less than its constituent parts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Early investigations of the frequency of synchronous vs.
 compensatory dynamics focused on the variance ratio, that is, the variance
 of the sum of the community biomass divided by the sum of the variance
 of the component species biomasses 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "houlahan_compensatory_2007,gonzalez2009causes"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Unfortunately, this metric is not appropriate for communities subjected
 to community-wide environmental forcing 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ranta_detecting_2008"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, because a main environmental driver (e.g., temperature or light) may synchronize
 species abundances or growth rates at some scale, creating large variance
 in community-wide biomass, in spite of strongly competitive dynamics.
 Further research has therefore focused on specific timeframes where compensator
y dynamics may be found (e.g., below the seasonal scale where temperature
 fluctuations tend to synchronize species dynamics, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "vasseur_synchronous_2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite this effort to look for more meaningful temporal scales in biodiversity
 time series, temporal compensation has remained surprinsingly elusive in
 the field (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "houlahan_compensatory_2007,vasseur_synchronous_2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

; but see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ernest2008zero,christensen2018long"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Most datasets used so far to evaluate temporal compensation vs synchrony
 involve planktonic organisms ( 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "vasseur2007spectral,vasseur_synchronous_2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) or terrestrial plants (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "houlahan_compensatory_2007,gross2013species"
literal "false"

\end_inset

; though see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "bell_stability_2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 ).
 Here, we take advantage of a long-term bird time series record at the monthly
 scale (over 35 years
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Considering only the years used in our analysis.
 Otherwise, the dataset begins in 1973.
\end_layout

\end_inset

), in a natural reserve, that allows us to dig deeper into patterns of synchrony
, at several temporal and taxonomic or functional scales.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed, taxonomic scale should be a main modulator of synchrony/compensation,
 an explanatory factor that has been somewhat neglected for now.
 On the one hand, one could argue that compensation should be higher between
 closely related species, because functional and phylogenetic differences
 are generally correlated.
 For example, if species A and B are two duck species that share almost
 the same food niche as well as many traits, it makes little difference
 to the rest of the community whether one species gets replaced by the other
 (functional compensation,
\emph on
 sensu
\emph default
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gonzalez2009causes"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), and priority effects could dominate.
 On the other hand, it could be argued that these two similar duck species
 will precisely respond in similar ways to environmental variables, which
 tends to obfuscate compensation.
 Under the latter scenario, more dissimilar species or groups of species
 - within the same trophic level nonetheless - could compensate each other
 within the whole community, precisely because they have different environmental
 preferences and the environment varies over time (e.g., groups of species
 preferring more open vs more closed habitats replacing each other as a
 function of changes in vegetation height).
 Surprisingly, compensation between guilds has been less well explored than
 within guilds, even though there is actually some empirical evidence for
 compensation between dissimilar guilds 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "sinclair2013asynchronous"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 We therefore explore different ways to cluster the bird community, within
 or between guilds, along either taxonomic or functional classifications.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our objective is therefore to examine how synchronous or compensatory bird
 communities are at different temporal and taxonomic (or functional) scales.
 Our dataset is ideally suited to the task given that (i) it is a highly
 temporally resolved time series with respect to the species typical generation
 times, but it also extends well beyond generation time (35 years) and (ii)
 the reserve where the data has been collected was subjected to a major
 management change c.
 2006 (change in water levels), favouring different types of wetland birds
 (so that over long timescales, there is a real potential for changes in
 community composition).

Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The monthly time series used for the statistical analyses have been collected
 at the Teich Ornithological Reserve, Arcachon Bay, France (44.64°N / -1.02°E),
 by the staff of the Teich reserve.
 The reserve comprises 120 ha of wetlands, and the data have been aggregated
 at the reserve scale.
 We use for each species the maximum observed abundance over a month, which
 provides a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

monthly snapshot
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the bird abundance.
 In the statistical analyses, we use both the original monthly data and
 seasonal averages.
 We defined two seasons based on observations of bird presence.
 We defined a `warm season', from May to August, and a `cold season' as
 the months between November and February of the following year.
 From an ecological viewpoint, this seasonal classification separates wintering
 birds from summer residents (some of whom are breeding).
 This makes sense biologically because the two communities have different
 requirements and respond differentially to abiotic drivers.
 It is also useful from a more statistical perspective, as there is a shift
 in composition between the seasons, though winter and summer communities
 partially overlap due to a number of shared species.

 fluctuate independently.
 Contrary to previous indices (see, for instance, Loreau and de Mazancourt

 We averaged monthly bird abundances, for each species, over the season
 duration, and computed the synchrony index using the year as our statistical
 unit.
 We also differentiated periods before and after 2006, given that a management
 change occurred within the reserve in 2006.
 We considered both the synchrony inside a given group (e.g., among

Do we Bonferronni-correct? In this case, 5/16 for the 4 seasons? (4 groups/4
 season?)Do we add the equation for the p-value? Doesn't feel necessary
 to me but what do you think? We'll discuss for the Bonferroni, but that
 makes sense if we do it below? In any case we don't need to mention more
 here if we add the codes to the GitHub repo.
 I don't Bonferroni-correct for now.
 Thinking about it, wouldn't it be 5/(3*6*2) (3 periods of time, 6 groups,
 2 seasons) ? Bonferroni corrections might be too strong in this context,
 let's discuss that together.

 lowering the water levels, created more synchronous communities of species
 within the

 This increase in synchrony after 2006 is matched by the functional group
 classification.

Even though there is no widespread community-wide or genus-wide compensation
 at the yearly timescale (differentiating the seasons), there could be compensat
ion at finer temporal scales, e.g.
 a month or two, or coarser scales, over several years.
 The wavelet plot (Fig.

), that allows to consider a time-varying and scale-dependent strength of
 synchrony, suggests that there is synchrony even at a fine temporal scale
 throughout most of the time series.
 However, post-2006, there seems to be a possibility for overcompensation
 on a scale around 5 years or around 3-4 months.

There are therefore relatively contrasted results regarding the effect of
 the management change on short-term synchrony within the wader community.
 At the yearly (season) timescale, it seems to increase the synchrony (though
 the Gross index and wavelets provide slightly different answers).
 At even shorter timescales though, it seems to decrease it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More clear-cut results can be found when we examine the synchrony vs.
 compensation between functional groups (Fig.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 that synchrony is in fact the rule around the annual scale and below, when

 We wondered if the patterns in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 were caused by the use of a log scale, but we found that in fact the correlatio
n was higher rather than lower on the log scale (ESM 2).
 However, over long temporal scales (
\begin_inset Formula $\sim$
\end_inset

 6 years) there seems to be some compensation, traducing a progressive change
 in composition within this small community module, that was already visible
 on the time series plot (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Time-series-of"
plural "false"

).
 There might be some compensation over very short timescale as well (within
 the season), but at very specific times and the biological mechanisms for
 this are unclear since these species compete for roost sites, a process
 that it unlikely to manifest at such very short timescales.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Compensation was overall very rare at the yearly timescale (differentiating
 between the cold and warm season).
 At short timescales (below the season), and among taxonomically or functionally
 close species, some compensation could be found but only at certain periods.
 In other words, there was no widespread 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

functional compensation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (sensu

) 
\emph on
within
\emph default
 genera or guilds at the annual scale or below.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yet, summing species abundances within a guild and comparing the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

biomass sums
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of contrasted guilds, community composition did change in frequency in
 the long run; in other words, there was compensation 
\emph on
between
\emph default
 guilds.
 We used correlation between the summed abundances of closely related species
 (species within the 
\shape italic
Anas
\shape default
 genus vs.
 species within the 
\shape italic
Calidris
\shape default
 genus) or the summed abundances of functionally similar species (waders
 vs.
 ducks) to uncover this.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given that we compare the level of synchrony/compensation within guilds
 (with many species) and between guilds (with only a handful of groups),
 we checked in ESM 3 whether changing the number of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

compartments
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

) in the Gross 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 index could affect its value: it did not.
 However, we found that if two groups respond in opposite ways to a shared
 driver, the stronger the response to the driver, the lesser the compensation
 indicated by 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 at the whole community level.
 This might explain the low levels of compensation that we found at the
 overall wetland bird community level (ESM 1), in spite of the clear presence
 of two groups reacting in opposite way to shared driver (here, water levels).
 Analyses at several taxonomic/functional scales are therefore warranted
 to be conclusive about compensation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The functional group classification produced much more clearly compensation
 between guilds than the taxonomic classification.
 We expected to see compensation at that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

functional scale
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 irrespective of the season, because the requirements of these birds are
 different, but here waders and ducks were found to correlate negatively
 only during the cold (wintering) season.
 This may be because the summer is characterized by a broad inflow of birds,
 including non-resident individuals that somehow add random variation to
 the community dynamics (though other explanations are possible).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It may be better to say that we detected 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

compensation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 rather than 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

compensatory dynamics
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 between bird species 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gonzalez2009causes"

\end_inset

 as the observed long-term changes in species composition (more waders,
 
\change_inserted -666822487 1537458550
proportionally 
\change_unchanged
less ducks; ESM4) might be due to an increased inflow of birds preferring
 low water levels, and outflow of birds preferring high water levels, under
 an overall space constraint.
 In other words, the shift in community dynamics is likely not directly
 due to birth and deaths.
 However, despite the importance of movements and habitat preference to
 the local community dynamics, there is certainly also an influence of the
 regional changes in births and deaths on these local dynamics.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zooming in on the cormorant-heron-egret module, we find that compensation
 mostly occurs above the annual temporal scale, and predominantly in summer
 as well as before 2006.
 This occurs because of a long-term shift due to competition for resting/roostin
g sites in the summer season
\change_inserted -666822487 1537297487
 (C.
 Feigné, pers.
 obs.)
\change_unchanged
, which mostly occurred before 2006.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall, our results suggest to search for compensation more often
\emph on
 between
\emph default
 rather than 
\emph on
within
\emph default
 functional groups, and over relatively long timescales above that of the
 dominant driver (e.g., above 5 years if the main driver is a seasonal climate).
 This goes against calls to search for compensation at very short timescales
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "vasseur2007spectral,gonzalez2009causes"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 in order to filter out the effect of the main seasonal driver.
 Although searching for compensation at temporal scales below the seasonal
 abiotic driver (e.g., temperature) was partly motivated by studies on plankton
 whose community dynamics are much faster, we could have expected compensation
 to manifest also that scale here as well (e.g., monthly).
 Movement of birds reacting to food availability can certainly occur that
 fast, and wetlands certainly have a carrying capacity, which could promote
 short-term compensation.
 We suspect that instead, because many species share common abiotic drivers
 at short temporal scales 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "loreau_species_2008"

, compensation is bound to be quite rare below the dominant temporal scale
 of the environment.

In many ways, searching for compensation using biodiversity time series

 Although the knowledge of specific biological mechanisms increasing the

 will likely dominate community-level time series data for closely related
 species, even in species that compete strongly

 This is true even in cases of known mechanisms of competition or shifts

 We suggest that

 taxonomically or functionally (considering summed abondances of dissimilar
 functional groups) and temporally (considering temporal scales well above

 within bounds.

Gross' synchrony index for different time series length and number of species
 in the community, in simulations where there is an increasing trend in
 the environmental signal and the data is subsampled (for 35 or 100 time
 steps), removing part of the autocorrelation of the environment in the
 dynamics of the species

We first confirm that unless there is a high autocorrelation in the driver
 (as in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

), if we consider two groups which have opposite reactions to the same driver,
 the Gross index is not sensitive to the length of the time series or to
 the number of species in the community.
 For larger communities (over 10 species), synchrony is higher when the
 response to the driver is stronger.
 For our data, this means that the more birds are sensitive to the water
 level, the less we can expect compensation at the whole community level.
