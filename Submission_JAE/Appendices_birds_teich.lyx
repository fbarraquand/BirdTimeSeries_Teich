 The index was computed in each panel on the whole dataset (black) or using
 two periods: before and after 2006 (light and dark blue), the year of the

 Red stars correspond to synchrony values significantly different from the
 null model (independent species), at the Bonferroni-corrected 10% threshold.

\begin_layout Standard
We noted on Fig.
 4 in the main text that cormorants, herons and egrets seemed to compensate
 each other, at least for the first period of the time series.
 This compensation was seen on a log scale, and seemed conspicuous on that
 scale.
 We thus wondered if log-transforming the abundance would affect the values
 of the synchrony index observed for this group, and make compensation more
 likely.
 It appears to be the reverse: synchrony values are higher with log-transformed
 abundances.

 Open circles represent all points of the time series while large filled

 Cold colors indicate species which react positively to the environmental

 The environmental signal is shown in black, dashed lines, and indexed on
 the right axis.
 This signal either follows an increasing trend (a), or just an autocorrelated

\begin_layout Standard
We compared results for time series of length 35 (the length of our data
 set when computing 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

), 100 and 500.
 For all simulation experiments, the dynamics are first run for 500 time
 steps as a burn-in.
 To take into account different observational designs, we either take the
 first 35 or 100 time steps of the following 500-time steps series, or subsample
 the time series in order to get 35 or 100 time points (which removes some
 autocorrelation in the dynamics).
 We also considered several community richness (10, 30, 60 and 100 species),
 and several strengths of the response to the environmental signal (
\begin_inset Formula $b=$
\end_inset

[0.1, 0.5, 0.75]).
 For each combination of parameters, we computed 10 repetitions (i.e., replicates).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We considered different types of environmental driver (simply autocorrelated
 or with a linear trend), crossed with subsampling / no subsampling as described
 above.
 We considered in total three scenarios, and present below how an increasing
 strength of response to the environment changes expectations for all three:

We first confirm that unless there is a very high temporal autocorrelation
 in the driver (as in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:notrend"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), if we consider two groups which have opposite reactions to the same driver,
 the Gross index is not sensitive to the length of the time series or to
 the number of species in the community, in the sense that it will not indicate
 falsely synchrony.
 The main finding of these analyses, aside from the robustness of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 index, is that for large communities (over 10 species), synchrony is always
 higher when the response to the driver is stronger.
 Coming back to the interpretation of our results in the Teich reserve case,
 this means that the more bird population growth rates respond to changes
 in the water levels, the less we can expect compensation at the whole community
 level, even though compensation may be manifest at the functional group
 level (here, the group of species responding similarly to the environmental
 variable).

I think the problem was that we did not describe enough the results actually
 - the presentation of the methods was OK but we needed to explain what
 we found.
 I therefore tried to do that a little bit.

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The results show that while the statistical significance of the values
 can change (i.e., the data is more compatible with the null hypothesis of
 time series uncorrelated between species, assuming the null is true), the
 occurrence of compensation (blue values in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

) does not.
 The wavelet coherence index is therefore robust to the presence of zeroes
 in the time series.
