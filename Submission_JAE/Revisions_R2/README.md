This folder contains figures that were modified for revision2. 

* `average_abundance_timeseries_v2.pdf` represent the time series and was modified to be easier to read
* all Fig2 present the Gross index within and between the Anas, Calidris, wader and waterfowl groups, re-analysed with 1000 surrogates and a new colour code (shades of blue should be easier to differentiate)
* `triad_synchrony_2panels_abundances_*` are the Gross index and the wavelet modulus ratio analysis with 100 or 1000 IAAFT-based surrogates, with a small grid, same date per month for all species, and no correction on the p-value
* `synchrony_indices_frequent_abundances_*` are the Gross index and the wavelet modulus ratio analysis with 100 or 1000 IAAFT-based surrogates, with a small grid, same date per month for all species, and no correction on the p-value
* `wavelet_wader_waterfowl*` are the wavelet modulus ration analyses with 1000 IAAFT-based surrogates, with a small grid, same date per month for all species, and no correction on the p-value

The file `wavelet_analysis_thoughts.pdf` is a summary of our investigation on the mvcwt package.
