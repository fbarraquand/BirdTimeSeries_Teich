This folder is meant to examine the way the Gross index and the wavelet modulus ratio react to skewed abundance distribution. As abundances follow a log-normal distribution in real data (`check_lognormal.R`, producing the figure `distrib_average_abundance.pdf`), we use the same distribution for communities following different dynamics. We can either have a pairwise fixed negative correlation (pair), a quasi normal distribution of covariation between species (alpha15, beta15), a compensation case (alpha2, beta4) or a synchrony case (alpha4, beta2). Communities can be made of either 4 or 40 species. All are affected by a seasonal signal. The script used to model them is `MultivariateNormalModels_SAD.R` producing `MockData*` files (dynamics) and `MuSigma*` files (average abundance and covariance matrix). These are also presented in a figure (`distrib_average_abundance_simulation.pdf`). Time series are plotted by `time_series.R` while the file `essai_two_panels` produce the Gross and Keitt indices, with classical surrogates for the Keitt analysis, that is the ones obtained with phase-shifted surrogates. The file `use_iaaft_simulations.r` produce the same indices, but surrogates for the Keitt analysis are based on the IAAFT of time series. All analyses were performed with 1000 surrogates, no correction on the p-value associated with the wavelet analysis and a small grid.
