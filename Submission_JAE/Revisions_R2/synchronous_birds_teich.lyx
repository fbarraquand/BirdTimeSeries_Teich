\begin_layout Abstract
1.
 Compensatory dynamics, during which community composition shifts despite
 a near-constant total community size, are usually rare: synchronous dynamics
 prevail in natural communities.
 This is a puzzle for ecologists, because of the key role of compensation
 in explaining the relation between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
2.
 However, most studies so far have considered compensation in either plants
 or planktonic organisms, so that evidence for the generality of such synchrony
 is limited.
 Here, we extend analyses of community-level synchrony to wetland birds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
3.
 We analyse a 35-year monthly survey of a community where we suspected that
 compensation might occur due to changes in water levels, favouring birds
 with different habitat preferences, and potential competition.
 We perform both yearly analyses by season, using a synchrony index, as
 well as monthly analyses using a wavelet-based measure allowing for scale-
 and time-dependence.
 We analyse synchrony both within and between guilds, with guilds defined
 either as tightknit phylogenetic groups or larger functional groups.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
4.
 We find that abundance compensation is rare, likely due to the synchronizing
 influence of climate
\change_inserted -666822487 1596383224
 (and other drivers)
\change_unchanged
 on birds, even after considering several temporal scales of covariation
 (during either cold or warm seasons, above or below the

seasonal
\change_inserted -666822487 1596383281
annual

 scale).
 Negative covariation in abundance at the guild or community level did only
 appear at the scale of a few months or several years.
 We also found that synchrony varies with taxonomic and functional scale:
 the rare cases where compensation appeared consistently at the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
5.
 Although most research has focused on viewing compensation vs synchrony
 across temporal scales, because synchrony is guaranteed at the temporal
 scale of the dominant environmental forcing, our results suggest that compensat
ion can be masked as well at some taxonomic or functional scales.
 We suggest that abundance compensation may have more potential to emerge
 between broad functional groups, rather between species.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Density compensation occurs when individuals of a given species replace
 individuals of other species within a community, either because of explicit
 competitive processes or shifts in environmental drivers that change selection
 pressures 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gonzalez2009causes"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 The community as a whole then exhibits lower biomass variation than its
 constituent species 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gross2013species"
literal "true"

\end_inset

: some degree of compensation or asynchrony is therefore a prerequisite
 to stabilization at the community level 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "loreau2013biodiversity"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Understanding why environmental variation may lead to compensation is relatively
 easy: if species have different environmental preferences (e.g., thermal
 optima), and the environment changes over time, different species will
 be fittest

\end_inset

 at different points in time.
 As a consequence, relative abundances will shift over time even though
 the community biomass as a whole may remain relatively stable 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gonzalez2009causes"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 However, the conditions for compensation to happen also depend on the particula
rs of the interactions between and within species in the community.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Compensation is particularly likely to occur when such temporal environmental
 variation combines with a space constraint or with a strongly limiting
 resource, so that individuals are close to competing in a zero-sum game
 (sensu 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "hubbell2001unified"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 or lottery-style models, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "chesson_multispecies_1994"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 When the total community size is constant over time, and the composition
 fluctuates, negative covariation between abundances then emerges by design
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "loreau_species_2008"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 since no species can increase without another species decreasing in abundance.
 Outside of this zero-sum scenario, in models where Lotka-Volterra competition
 is combined with temporal environmental variability, theoretical research
 has revealed that increased interspecific competition might not increase
 species compensation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ives_stability_1999"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and might even decrease it 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
before "i.e., increase species synchrony instead,"
key "loreau_species_2008,loreau2013biodiversity"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, though this depends on the fluctuation regime.
 Thus, in a world where total community size varies, predicting whether
 compensatory (or asynchronous) dynamics can occur is intrinsically difficult
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "klink_functional_2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Early investigations of the frequency of synchronous vs compensatory dynamics
 focused on the variance ratio, that is, the variance of the sum of the
 community biomass divided by the sum of the variance of the component species
 biomasses 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "houlahan_compensatory_2007,gonzalez2009causes"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Unfortunately, this metric is not appropriate for communities subjected
 to community-wide environmental forcing 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ranta_detecting_2008"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, because a main environmental driver (e.g., temperature or light) may synchronize
 species abundances or growth rates at some scale, creating large variance
 in community-wide biomass, in spite of strongly competitive dynamics.
 Further research has therefore focused on specific timeframes during which
 compensatory dynamics may be found (e.g., below the seasonal scale at which
 temperature fluctuations tend to synchronize species dynamics, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "vasseur_synchronous_2014"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite efforts to look for more meaningful temporal scales in community-level
 time series, temporal compensation has remained surprinsingly elusive in
 the field

; but see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "ernest2008zero,christensen2018long"

 Most datasets used so far to evaluate temporal compensation vs synchrony
 involve planktonic organisms 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 in beetles).
 Here, we take advantage of a long-term bird abundance time series record
 at the monthly scale (over 35 years), in a natural reserve, allowing us
 to dig deeper into patterns of synchrony, at several temporal and taxonomic
 or functional scales.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed, taxonomic and functional scales should be main modulators of synchrony/c
ompensation.
 On the one hand, compensation can be high between similar and closely related
 species.
 If two species of ducks A and B share almost the same niche, individuals
 from either species experience similar competition from species A or B,
 and should feel the effects of other species in the community identically.
 This favours priority effects 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "fukami_historical_2015"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, with chance due to movement events determining whether species A or B
 locally dominates, which can then provide compensation at the landscape
 level 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "loreau2003biodiversity"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 On the other hand, it could be argued that these two similar duck species
 will precisely respond in similar ways to environmental variables, which
 tends to obfuscate compensation.
 Hence, more dissimilar species or groups (within the same trophic level
 nonetheless) could exhibit more compensation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "bai2004ecosystem,morin2014temporal,klink_functional_2019"

 because they are more likely to respond to the environment in an asynchronous
 manner (

 In this paper, we explore the level of compensation/synchrony within or
 between guilds of a wetland bird community, along either taxonomic or functiona
l classifications.
 Although a functional classification might appear intuitively more appealing,
 our knowledge of functional traits is necessarily partial and imperfect,
 so that a taxonomic description can sometimes be preferable

\begin_layout Standard
Our objective is therefore to examine how synchronous or compensatory bird
 communities are at different temporal and taxonomic (or functional) scales.
 Our dataset is ideally suited to the task given that (i) it is a highly
 temporally resolved time series with respect to the species typical generation
 times, but it also extends well beyond generation time (35 years) and (ii)
 the reserve where the data has been collected was subjected to a major
 management change c.
 2006 (change in water levels), favouring different types of wetland birds
 (so that over long timescales, there is a real potential for changes in
 community composition).

 We use for each species the maximum observed abundance over a month, which
 provides a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

monthly snapshot
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the bird abundance, that has been used to monitor the reserve since
 its inception.
 When abundance values are missing for certain species and months, we replace
 them by 0s.
 Given the sustained observation effort (all sectors are patrolled multiple
 times throughout the month by the staff, amateur ornithologists visiting
 the reserve daily and communicating their findings to the reserve staff),
 we consider that the absence of counts for a given species signals its
 true absence from the reserve.
 This creates some zero abundances for rare species at the monthly scale.
 We have not attempted to

 In the statistical analyses, we use seasonally averaged abundances (plotted

), as well as the original monthly data (presented in Appendix S2).
 We defined two seasons based on observations of bird presence.
 We defined a `warm season', from May to August, and a `cold season' as
 the months between November and February of the following year.
 From an ecological viewpoint, this seasonal classification separates wintering
 birds from summer residents (some of whom are breeding).
 This makes sense biologically because the two communities have different
 requirements and could respond differentially to abiotic drivers.
 It is also useful from a more statistical perspective, as there is a

 Waders and ducks have different environmental preferences, with ducks (and
 waterfowl more generally) preferring water levels allowing them to dive,
 while waders usually forage on mudflats.
 A list of all birds found frequently in the reserve is presented in Appendix
 S1; aside from waders and waterfowl, other common species include herons,
 egrets and cormorants (see below).
 Among the fish eaters, grebes and gulls were also present; a few raptors
 as well.

To examine compensation

within

 the waders and waterfowl categories, we contrasted analyses using a taxonomic
 classification of the species (i.e., between and within phylogenetic groups
 such as genera) and a functional classification of the species (26 species
 of waders vs 17 species of waterfowl).
 The waterfowl group includes all anatids (ducks, geese and swans in particular)
 as well as the common coot 
\emph on
(Fulica atra

, an abundant species here, which is a Rallidae but resembles a duck in
 morphology and foraging habits; hence its inclusion).

We computed the statistical significance of the synchrony index by comparing
 the observed values to the distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 under the null hypothesis 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gouhier_synchrony_2014"

\end_inset

, which amounts to zero cross-correlations between species abundances (or
 guild-level abundances
\change_inserted -666822487 1596385242
,
\change_unchanged
 when considering 
\change_inserted -666822487 1596385248
taxonomic or 
\change_unchanged
functional groups).
 The challenge, in order to construct such null hypothesis, is to remove
 all cross-correlations while keeping the exact same autocorrelation in
 each individual time series.
 Therefore, for each set of time series (each combination year 
\begin_inset Formula $\times$
\end_inset

 season for a given community), we constructed 100
\change_inserted -666822487 1596288970
0
\change_unchanged
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

surrogates
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in which we kept auto-correlations but removed cross-correlations between
 time series.
 There are multiple ways to erase cross-correlations depending on the resolution
 of the considered community.
 Within guilds, we shifted the time-series 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "purves_fine-scale_2002"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 while between guilds (two groups only), we used a frequency-based approach
 (Iterated Amplitude-Adjusted Fourier Transform or IAAFT, see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "schreiber_surrogate_2000"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 We first explain the shift-based approach: the suite of abundance values
 (after seasonal averaging) is displaced by a random temporal lag 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, so that a value 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}$
\end_inset

 is now found at 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t+\tau}$
\end_inset

.
 At the boundary (the end of the time series), remaining points are displaced
 towards the beginning of the time-series, which implements a toroidal shift.
 This method works well when comparing many times series corresponding to
 the multiple species.
 However, when computing synchrony across only two groups (between guilds),
 spurious cross-correlations could emerge with a shift-based approach as
 the number of possible combinations is more limited.
 Therefore, to test for synchrony between the summed abundances of two guilds
 or taxonomic units, we used the more sophisticated IAAFT method 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "schreiber_surrogate_2000"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, which retains the frequency spectrum of the time series while randomising
 its values.
 We obtained 10
\change_inserted -666822487 1596289002
0
\change_unchanged
0 sets of randomised time series for each computed synchrony index.
 We then compared the number of 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{H0}$
\end_inset

 values which exceeded or were inferior to the observed value to compute
 the p-value 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "north_note_2002"
literal "false"

\end_inset

: we use the ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $(r+1)/(n+1)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is the number of surrogate values that are 
\begin_inset Formula $\ge\eta_{obs}$
\end_inset

, respectively 
\begin_inset Formula $\le\eta_{obs}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is the number of surrogates.
 Independence of species was rejected at the 10% threshold with a Benjamini-Hoch
berg correction, as we compare across 2 seasons and 3 periods, with partially
 overlapping data.
 This was found satisfactory based on simulated data, although power is
 low for detecting compensation (i.e., the null cannot always be rejected)
 when only two groups are compared.

Compensation could be expected upon visual inspection of the time series

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 that synchrony is in fact the rule around the annual scale and below, when

 We wondered if the patterns in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

n was higher rather than lower on the log scale (Appendix S4).
 However, over long temporal scales (

 the progressive change in composition within this small community module,
 that was already visible on the abundance time series plot (Fig.

 It did not have marked effects, unless the number of compartments is equal
 to 2, in which case
\change_deleted -666822487 1596386569
,
\change_unchanged
 significance is hard to achieve and some compensatory dynamics can be missed
 with weak environmental response.
 
\change_deleted -666822487 1596386584
However
\change_inserted -666822487 1596386586
Additionally
\change_unchanged
, we found 
\change_inserted -666822487 1596386690
– still using this dynamical model –
\change_unchanged
that if two guilds respond in opposite ways to a shared 
\change_inserted -666822487 1596386660
environmental 
\change_unchanged
driver, the stronger the response
\change_inserted -666822487 1596386654
 of growth rates
\change_unchanged
 to the driver, the lesser the compensation indicated by 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 at the whole community level.
 
\change_inserted -666822487 1596386927
An intuitive explanation of this modelling result is that when there are
 two groups and many species within a group, a stronger forcing homogeneizes
 the dynamics within a group as much as it creates differences between groups.
 
\change_unchanged
This might explain the low levels of compensation that we found 
\change_inserted -666822487 1596386942
in our empirical dataset, 
\change_unchanged
at the overall wetland bird community level (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:synchrony-whole-comm"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), in spite of the clear presence of two guilds (waders and waterfowl) reacting
 in opposite way to a shared driver (here, water levels).
 Analyses at several taxonomic/functional scales are therefore warranted
 to be conclusive about compensation
\change_deleted -666822487 1596386955
.
\change_inserted -666822487 1596386977

 The functional group classification produced some compensation between
 guilds while the taxonomic classification did not, despite the contrasted
 habitat preferences of these two phylogenetic groups.
 Using functional groups produced more logical results, although as we stressed

irrespective of the season, because the requirements of these birds are
 different:  water levels good for waders are usually less appropriate for
 waterfowl and vice versa
\change_inserted -666822487 1596387353
for both cold and warm seasons.
 The separation of seasons allowed to differentiate summer residents (some
 of whom may be breeding) and wintering birds,
\change_deleted -666822487 1596387278

\change_inserted -666822487 1596387369

\change_deleted -666822487 1596387374

\change_inserted -666822487 1596387398
In both of those seasons though
\change_unchanged
, 
\change_inserted -666822487 1596387472
we had reason to expect waders and waterfowl to have different environmental
 preferences.
 Instead, waders and waterfowl
\change_deleted -666822487 1596387116
these
\change_unchanged
 were found to correlate negatively only during the cold (wintering) season.
 
\change_deleted -666822487 1596387149
This can be explained by a broad inflow of birds in the summer, including
 non-resident individuals that add random variation to the community dynamics
 (though other explanations are possible)
\change_unchanged
.

\change_inserted -666822487 1596388586
 A simple explanation is that the reserve might be closer to its carrying
 capacity for these species in winter, so that space is limited and increases
 in one functional group are compensated by decreases in the other.
 One should keep in mind that the dominant species in each guild (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Temporal-trends"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), 
\emph on
C.
 alpina
\emph default
 for waders and 
\emph on
A.
 crecca
\emph default
 for waterfowl, are migratory species whose wintering individuals are more
 abundant in winter in that area.
 So there are increased population densities of those species in winter.
 Of course, the space constraint should not be taken too literally: birds
 are obviously mobile and do forage outside of the reserve (e.g., waders moving
 to the nearby Arcachon bay mudflats), but there are costs to those movements
 (energetics, mortality risk due to nearby hunting) which make the reserve
 a very attractive wintering site where birds both rest and forage.
 Packing even more birds over its 120 ha may just not be feasible, so that
 increases in one guild result in decrease in the other.
 With that theory, compensation might therefore be easier to detect during
 the cold season because the study area is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

filled
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and it is not detected in our warm season (May to August) because there
 are less birds overall.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\change_inserted -666822487 1596388737
An alternative idea is that although space may be likewise limited in spring
 and summer, the nature of bird individuals may be more varied in summer:
 some individuals are breeders and compete locally for space and food resources,
 while other individuals are just passing through.
 
\change_deleted -666822487 1596351196
 
\change_inserted -666822487 1596388831
Disentangling this and the carrying capacity hypotheses would likely require
 further inquiry on a species-by-species basis, investigating in detail
 life histories.

might be

Synchrony in a small module with known competition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zooming in on the cormorant-heron-egret module, for which we knew beforehand
 that competition for resting and roosting sites in the summer season occurs
 between, on the one hand, 
\change_inserted -666822487 1596389746
great 
\change_unchanged
cormorants, and on the other hand, little egrets and grey herons (C.
 Feigné, pers.
 obs.).
 Abundance time series suggested some negative correlation, but it was not
 found on the annual scale for which synchrony (or an absence of relation)
 dominates.
 Instead, we find that compensation mostly occurs above the annual temporal
 scale, approximatively on a scale of 6 years, much above the annual scale.
 This may indeed be a consequence of the slow shift in frequencies of cormorants
 and little egrets / grey herons.

\change_inserted -666822487 1596389886
 Compensation was also found episodically (for a given year) at shorter
 timescales (a few months).
 This may be a consequence of a greater difference between the periods during
 which each functional group is most abundant that year (i.e., a phenological
 mismatch).

\begin_layout Standard
Overall, our results suggest to search for compensation more often
\emph on
 between

 rather than 
\emph on
within

 functional groups, and over relatively long timescales, above the typical
 temporal autocorrelation of the dominant driver (e.g., above 5 years if the
 main driver is a seasonal climate).
 This rejoins the recent findings of

 who found that increased functional differences between species tend to
 decrease synchrony

\change_inserted -666822487 1596390978
In theory, 
\change_unchanged
we could have expected compensation to manifest also at 
\change_deleted -666822487 1596391268
that
\change_inserted -666822487 1596391271

\change_unchanged
(
\change_deleted -666822487 1596391278
e.g.,

monthly).
 Indeed, 
\change_inserted -666822487 1596391021
the community dynamics in our case are driven by the 
\change_unchanged
movement

 Such behavioural dynamics

\change_deleted -666822487 1596391164
, and wetlands have a finite carrying capacity, so that there is competition
 for space, which could promote short-term compensation

.
 
\change_deleted -666822487 1596391326
Such
\change_inserted -666822487 1596391327
However, such
\change_unchanged
 compensation due to short-term movements did not occur here.
 We suspect that instead, because many species share common abiotic and
 biotic drivers (e.g., disturbances due to nearby hunting

\change_unchanged

It is noteworthy that even in planktonic systems, the temporal scale of
 compensation has often been found to be well above that of the forcing
 driver 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Thus our findings contribute to suggesting to search for compensation over
 relatively long timescales (several years for vertebrates or plants).

\begin_layout Standard
The attractor of community dynamics, i.e., the shape of community trajectories
 in phase space, seems to be more or less an annual cycle here: the dominant
 species fluctuate seasonally, but even though there are shifts in some
 species dynamics, no abundant species seem to exhibit violent multi-year
 oscillations.
 If we had to describe our community mathematically, a dynamical model with
 a stable fixed point forced by seasonality and some noise would probably
 be appropriate.
 This mild fluctuation scenario somehow contrasts with the dynamics of other
 communities, such as insect pests, that have quite often multi-year cycles
 (on top of seasonal cycles, for multivoltine species), with possibly strong
 indirect interactions between similar species mediated by predators and
 parasitoids 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 In the latter context of internally-generated variability (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 recently reported only transient synchrony between species of moths, so
 that compensation could occur more frequently for more strongly oscillating
 species.
 Therefore, compensation could be more frequent for those groups at the
 yearly timescale.
 Whether or not these findings have some generality remains to be investigated
 by examining multi-species synchrony for more varied animal taxa.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In many ways, searching for abundance compensation using biodiversity time
 series data is searching for needles in a haystack: only some specific
 temporal and functional/taxonomic scales allow to see compensation whilst
 numerous confounding factors make the community co-vary positively at all
 other scales

.
 Although the knowledge of specific biological mechanisms increasing the
 densities of some species at the expense of others can help, synchrony
 will likely dominate community-level time series data for closely related
 species, even in species that compete strongly 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ranta_detecting_2008,loreau_species_2008"

 This is true even in cases of known mechanisms of competition for space
 or shifts in community composition due to abiotic changes affecting differentia
lly species preferences, as in this study.
 We therefore suggest that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 functionally (considering summed abundances of dissimilar functional groups)
 and temporally (considering temporal scales well above the periodicity
 of the dominant abiotic driver) may often be the best strategy to see the
 compensation that will inevitably manifest
\change_inserted -666822487 1596391598

 if the community-level biomass is to be maintained within bounds in the
