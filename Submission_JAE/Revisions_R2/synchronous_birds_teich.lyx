\begin_layout Abstract
1.
 Compensatory dynamics, during which community composition shifts despite
 a near-constant total community size, are usually rare: synchronous dynamics
 prevail in natural communities.
 This is a puzzle for ecologists, because of the key role of compensation
 in explaining the relation between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
2.
 However, most studies so far have considered compensation in either plants
 or planktonic organisms, so that evidence for the generality of such synchrony
 is limited.
 Here, we extend analyses of community-level synchrony to wetland birds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
3.
 We analyse a 35-year monthly survey of a community where we suspected that
 compensation might occur due to changes in water levels, favouring birds
 with different habitat preferences, and potential competition.
 We perform both yearly analyses by season, using a synchrony index, as
 well as monthly analyses using a wavelet-based measure allowing for scale-
 and time-dependence.
 We analyse synchrony both within and between guilds, with guilds defined
 either as tightknit phylogenetic groups or larger functional groups.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
4.
 We find that abundance compensation is rare, likely due to the synchronizing
 influence of climate (and other drivers) on birds, even after considering
 several temporal scales of covariation (during either cold or warm seasons,
 above or below the annual scale).
 Negative covariation in abundance at the guild or community level did only
 appear at the scale of a few months or several years.
 We also found that synchrony varies with taxonomic and functional scale:
 the rare cases where compensation appeared consistently at the seasonal
 scale were 
\emph on
between
\emph default
 rather than 
\emph on
within
\emph default
 guilds, using functional groups.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
5.
 Our results suggest that abundance compensation may have more potential
 to emerge between broad functional groups rather than between species,
 as well as at relatively long temporal scales (multiple years for vertebrates),
 above that of the dominant synchronizing driver.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Density compensation occurs when individuals of a given species replace
 individuals of other species within a community, either because of explicit
 competitive processes or shifts in environmental drivers that change selection
 pressures 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gonzalez2009causes"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 The community as a whole then exhibits lower biomass variation than its
 constituent species 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gross2013species"
literal "true"

\end_inset

: some degree of compensation or asynchrony is therefore a prerequisite
 to stabilization at the community level 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "loreau2013biodiversity"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Understanding why environmental variation may lead to compensation is relatively
 easy: if species have different environmental preferences (e.g., thermal
 optima), and the environment changes over time, different species will
 be fittest

\end_layout

\end_inset

 at different points in time.
 As a consequence, relative abundances will shift over time even though
 the community biomass as a whole may remain relatively stable 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gonzalez2009causes"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 However, the conditions for compensation to happen also depend on the particula
rs of the interactions between and within species in the community.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Compensation is particularly likely to occur when such temporal environmental
 variation combines with a space constraint or with a strongly limiting
 resource, so that individuals are close to competing in a zero-sum game
 (sensu 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "hubbell2001unified"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 or lottery-style models, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "chesson_multispecies_1994"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 When the total community size is constant over time, and the composition
 fluctuates, negative covariation between abundances then emerges by design
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "loreau_species_2008"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 since no species can increase without at least another species decreasing
 in abundance.
 Outside of this zero-sum scenario, in models where Lotka-Volterra competition
 is combined with temporal environmental variability, theoretical research
 has revealed that increased interspecific competition might not always
 increase species compensation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ives_stability_1999"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and might even decrease it 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
before "i.e., increase species synchrony instead,"
key "loreau_species_2008,loreau2013biodiversity"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, though this depends on the fluctuation regime.
 Thus, in a world where total community size varies, predicting whether
 compensatory (or asynchronous) dynamics can occur is intrinsically difficult
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "klink_functional_2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Early investigations of the frequency of synchronous vs compensatory dynamics
 focused on the variance ratio, that is, the variance of the sum of the
 community biomass divided by the sum of the variance of the component species
 biomasses 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "houlahan_compensatory_2007,gonzalez2009causes"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Unfortunately, this metric is not appropriate for communities subjected
 to community-wide environmental forcing 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ranta_detecting_2008"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, because a main environmental driver (e.g., temperature or light) may synchronize
 species abundances or growth rates at some temporal scale, creating large
 variance in community-wide biomass, in spite of strongly competitive dynamics.
 Further research has therefore focused on specific timeframes during which
 compensatory dynamics may be found (e.g., below the seasonal scale at which
 temperature fluctuations tend to synchronize species dynamics, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "vasseur_synchronous_2014"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite efforts to look for more meaningful temporal scales in community-level
 time series, temporal compensation has remained surprinsingly elusive in
 the field

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "ernest2008zero,christensen2018long"

 Most datasets used so far to evaluate temporal compensation vs synchrony
 involve planktonic organisms 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 in beetles).
 Here, we take advantage of a long-term bird abundance time series record
 at the monthly scale (over 35 years), in a natural reserve, allowing us
 to dig deeper into patterns of synchrony, at several temporal and taxonomic
 or functional scales.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed, taxonomic and functional scales should be main modulators of synchrony/c
ompensation.
 On the one hand, compensation can be high between similar and closely related
 species.
 If two species of ducks A and B share almost the same niche, individuals
 from either species experience similar competition from species A or B,
 and should feel the effects of other species in the community identically.
 This favours priority effects 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "fukami_historical_2015"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, with chance due to movement events determining whether species A or B
 locally dominates, which can then provide compensation at the landscape
 level 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "loreau2003biodiversity"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 On the other hand, it could be argued that these two similar duck species
 will precisely respond in similar ways to environmental variables, which
 tends to obfuscate compensation.
 Hence, more dissimilar species or groups (within the same trophic level
 nonetheless) could exhibit more compensation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "bai2004ecosystem,morin2014temporal,klink_functional_2019"

\end_inset

 because they are more likely to respond to the environment in an asynchronous
 manner (

 In this paper, we explore the level of compensation/synchrony within or
 between guilds of a wetland bird community, along either taxonomic or functiona
l classifications.
 Although a functional classification might appear intuitively more appealing,
 our knowledge of functional traits is necessarily partial and imperfect,
 so that a taxonomic description can sometimes be preferable

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our objective is therefore to examine how synchronous or compensatory bird
 communities are at different temporal and taxonomic (or functional) scales.
 Our dataset is ideally suited to the task given that (i) it is a highly
 temporally resolved time series with respect to the species typical generation
 times, but it also extends well beyond generation time (timespan of 35
 years) and (ii) the reserve where the data has been collected was subjected
 to a major management change c.
 2006 (change in water levels), favouring different types of wetland birds
 (so that over long timescales, there is a real potential for changes in
 community composition).

The monthly time series used for the statistical analyses have been collected

 sectors where the counts are actually performed, using binoculars).
 We use for each species the maximum observed abundance over a month, which
 provides a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

monthly snapshot
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the bird abundance, that has been used to monitor the reserve since
 its inception.
 When abundance values are missing for certain species and months, we replace
 them by zeroes.
 Given the sustained observation effort (all sectors are patrolled multiple
 times throughout the month by the staff, amateur ornithologists visiting
 the reserve daily and communicating their findings to the reserve staff),
 we consider that the absence of counts for a given species signals its
 true absence from the reserve.
 This creates some zero abundances for rare species at the monthly scale.
 We have not attempted to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

correct
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 those zeroes (e.g., inferring the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\end_inset

 data with a model assuming that our reserve is a subsample of a regional
 population) because doing so would have compromised the patterns of local
 synchrony/compensation.
 However, we did check 
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 since we have done this for wavelets
\end_layout

\end_inset

 that having such zeroes in the monthly time series cannot affect our conclusion
s (see SI).
 In the statistical analyses, we use seasonally averaged abundances (plotted
 in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Temporal-trends"
plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

), as well as the original monthly data (presented in Appendix S2).
 We defined two seasons based on observations of bird presence.
 We defined a `warm season', from May to August, and a `cold season' as
 the months between November and February of the following year.
 From an ecological viewpoint, this seasonal classification separates wintering
 birds from summer residents (some of whom are breeding).
 This makes sense biologically because the two communities have different
 requirements and could respond differentially to abiotic drivers.
 It is also useful from a more statistical perspective, as there is a partial
 shift in composition between the seasons, though winter and summer communities
 greatly overlap (i.e., species with greater abundances in the reserve in
 winter have also some summer residents, though these may be different individua
ls).

 Waders and ducks have different environmental preferences, with ducks (and
 waterfowl more generally) preferring water levels allowing them to dive,
 while waders usually forage on mudflats.
 A list of all birds found frequently in the reserve is presented in Appendix
 S1; aside from waders and waterfowl, other common species include herons,
 egrets and cormorants (see below).
 Among the fish eaters, grebes and gulls were frequently counted; a few

To examine compensation

 This synchrony index varies between -1 (perfect compensation, total biomass

 That is, we constructed two community-level time series of species abundances,
 one for the cold season and one for the warm season.
 To do so, we averaged monthly bird abundances, for each species, over the
 season duration.
 The synchrony index 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is therefore computed over all available years, but separately for both
 cold and warm seasons.
 In follow-up analyses, we also differentiated periods before and after
 2006, given that a management change occurred within the reserve in 2006.
 We considered both the synchrony within a given guild (e.g., among species
 of the 
\shape italic

 genus) or between guilds (e.g., between the summed abundances of the 7 species
 of tribe 
\shape italic

\shape default
 and
\emph on
 
\shape italic
the sum of the 7

 In the latter case of between-guilds comparisons, we summed species together
 before seasonal averaging, to consider seasonal averages of the monthly
 guild-level abundance.

 Finally, we computed

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We computed the statistical significance of the synchrony index by comparing
 the observed values to the distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 under the null hypothesis 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gouhier_synchrony_2014"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, which amounts to zero cross-correlations between species abundances (or
 guild-level abundances, when considering taxonomic or functional groups).
 The challenge, in order to construct such null hypothesis, is to remove
 all cross-correlations while keeping the exact same autocorrelation in
 each individual time series.
 Therefore, for each set of time series (each combination year 
\begin_inset Formula $\times$
\end_inset

 season for a given community), we constructed 1000 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

surrogates
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in which we kept auto-correlations but removed cross-correlations between
 time series.
 There are multiple ways to erase cross-correlations depending on the resolution
 of the considered community.
 Within guilds, we shifted the time-series 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "purves_fine-scale_2002"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 while between guilds (two groups only), we used a frequency-based approach
 (Iterative Amplitude-Adjusted Fourier Transform or IAAFT, see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "schreiber_surrogate_2000"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 We first explain the shift-based approach: the suite of abundance values
 (after seasonal averaging) is displaced by a random temporal lag 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, so that a value 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}$
\end_inset

 is now found at 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t+\tau}$
\end_inset

.
 At the boundary (the end of the time series), remaining points are displaced
 towards the beginning of the time-series, which implements a toroidal shift.
 This method works well when comparing many times series corresponding to
 the multiple species.
 However, when computing synchrony across only two groups (between guilds),
 spurious cross-correlations could emerge with a shift-based approach as
 the number of possible combinations is more limited.
 Therefore, to test for synchrony between the summed abundances of two guilds
 or taxonomic units, we used the more sophisticated IAAFT method 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "schreiber_surrogate_2000"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, which retains the frequency spectrum of the time series while randomising
 its values.
 We obtained 1000 sets of randomised time series for each computed synchrony
 index.
 We then compared the number of 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{H0}$
\end_inset

 values which exceeded or were inferior to the observed value to compute
 the p-value 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "north_note_2002"
literal "false"

\end_inset

: we use the ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $(r+1)/(n+1)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is the number of surrogate values that are 
\begin_inset Formula $\ge\eta_{obs}$
\end_inset

, respectively 
\begin_inset Formula $\le\eta_{obs}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is the number of surrogates.
 Independence of species was rejected at the 10% threshold with a Benjamini-Hoch
berg correction, as we compare across 2 seasons and 3 periods, with partially
 overlapping data.
 This was found satisfactory based on simulated data, although power is
 low for detecting compensation (i.e., the null cannot always be rejected)
 when only two groups are compared.

Wavelet analyses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to the time-domain analyses above, we performed wavelet analyses
 at multiple temporal scales, ranging from a month to several years.
 Wavelet analyses provide information on community synchrony for a given
 temporal scale or frequency, as well as a given location in time along
 the time series.
 This was done at the whole community level, including the 60 most frequent
 bird species, and for the rich wader and waterfowl communities, as well
 as the group formed by the great cormorant, grey heron and little egret.
 All wavelet analyses take as input the monthly time series data.

 The

For the cold season, abundances within

 change in 2006, with species within 
\emph on

 becoming less synchronous over time, although we should mention that these
 changes are not statistically significant.
 For the warm season, the management change, which consisted of lowering
 the water levels, created little change in communities of species within
 the 
\emph on

: they are all synchronous.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though there is no widespread community-wide or genus-wide compensation
 at the seasonal timescale, there could be compensation at finer temporal
 scales, e.g.
 a month or two, or coarser scales, over several years.
 Such compensation could also occur at specific time intervals instead of
 throughout the whole time series, a time-dependency that wavelet analyses
 allow to reveal.
 When we consider the wavelet modulus ratio (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Wavelet-modulus-ratio"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), that is, a time-varying and scale-dependent strength of synchrony, we
 can see that there is synchrony even at a fine temporal scale throughout
 most of the time series.
 However, post-2006, there seems to be a possibility for episodic compensation
 on a temporal scale of approximately 2-4 months, for both waders and waterfowl.
 There could also be within-guild compensation at scales of 5 years, approximate
ly post-2000 for waders and pre-2005 for waterfowl.
 Waterfowl synchrony trends likely influence whole-community trends (Fig.

 change on synchrony within guilds or within the whole bird community.
 At the seasonal timescale, the results are unclear for both guilds.
 At shorter (one or two months) and longer (five years) timescales though,
 the management change may decrease synchrony and even promote compensation.

\begin_layout Standard
Given that we compare the level of synchrony/compensation within guilds
 (with many species) and between guilds (with only a handful of groups),
 we checked in Appendix S5, using the dynamical model of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "gross2013species"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, if changing the number of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

compartments
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

) in the index 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 could affect its value.
 It did not have marked effects, unless the number of compartments is equal
 to 2, in which case significance is hard to achieve and some compensatory
 dynamics can be missed with weak environmental response.
 Additionally, we found – still using this dynamical model –that if two
 guilds respond in opposite ways to a shared environmental driver, the stronger
 the response of growth rates to the driver, the lesser the compensation
 indicated by 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 at the whole community level.
 An intuitive explanation of this modelling result is that when there are
 two groups and many species within a group, a stronger forcing homogeneizes
 the dynamics within a group as much as it creates differences between groups.
 This might explain the low levels of compensation that we found in our
 empirical dataset, at the overall wetland bird community level (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:synchrony-whole-comm"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), in spite of the clear presence of two guilds (waders and waterfowl) reacting
 in opposite way to a shared driver (here, water levels).
 Analyses at several taxonomic/functional scales are therefore warranted
 to be conclusive about compensation, which mirrors what was suggested by
 earlier plant studies

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We used correlation between the summed abundances of closely related species
 (species within the 
\shape italic

\emph on
tribe
\shape default
\emph default
 vs species within the 
\shape italic

 genus) or the summed abundances of functionally similar species (waders
 vs waterfowl) to uncover compensation.
 The functional group classification produced some compensation between
 guilds while the taxonomic classification did not, despite the contrasted
 habitat preferences of these two phylogenetic groups.
 Using functional groups produced more logical results, although as we stressed
 above, due to the low power of the tests, the null hypothesis of no compensatio
n at the yearly scale is still plausible as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We expected to see seasonal compensation at the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

functional group scale
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for both cold and warm seasons.
 The separation of seasons allowed to differentiate summer residents (some
 of whom may be breeding) and wintering birds, which we hoped might remove
 the overwhelming influence of the seasonal migratory cycle.
 In both of those seasons though, we had reason to expect waders and waterfowl
 to have different environmental preferences.
 Instead, waders and waterfowl were found to correlate negatively only during
 the cold (wintering) season.
 A simple explanation is that the reserve might be closer to its carrying
 capacity for these species in winter, so that space is limited and increases
 in one functional group are compensated by decreases in the other.
 One should keep in mind that the dominant species in each guild (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

), 
\emph on
C.
 alpina
\emph default
 for waders and 
\emph on
A.
 crecca
\emph default
 for waterfowl, are migratory species whose wintering individuals are more
 abundant in winter in that area.
 So there are increased population densities of those species in winter.
 Of course, the space constraint should not be taken too literally: birds
 are obviously mobile and do forage outside of the reserve (e.g., waders moving
 to the nearby Arcachon bay mudflats), but there are costs to those movements
 (energetics, mortality risk due to nearby hunting) which make the reserve
 a very attractive wintering site where birds both rest and forage.
 Packing even more birds over its 120 ha may just not be feasible, so that
 increases in one guild result in decrease in the other

 Just above, in the same paragraph ' so that space is limited and increases
 in one functional group are compensated by decreases in the other.' Yes
 that is on purpose.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 With that theory, compensation might therefore be easier to detect during
 the cold season because the study area is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

filled
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and it is not detected in our warm season (May to August) because there
 are less birds overall.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another reason why compensation between guilds might not be seen in the
 warm season pertains to differences in migratory and reproductive patterns
 of these two guilds.
 Although a number of waterfowl species breed in the reserve, most waders
 do not.
 Therefore, there is a greater difference between the spatial contraints
 of the two guilds in summer, with some waterfowl individuals that are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

locally anchored
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 while all waders are presumably very mobile.
 Further investigation on a species-by-species basis, with the knowledge
 of migratory patterns (phenology, total or partial migration, ...) and reproductiv
e status (i.e., which species is known to breed in the reserve), could reveal
 other interesting patterns of synchrony or compensation

\begin_layout Plain Layout

It may be better to say that we detected

 between bird species 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gonzalez2009causes"

\end_inset

, if compensatory dynamics is thought to result from births and deaths,
 i.e., population dynamics.
 Indeed, the observed long-term changes in species composition (more waders,
 proportionally less waterfowl; Appendix S2) is likely due to an increased
 inflow of birds preferring low water levels (waders), and outflow of birds
 preferring high water levels (waterfowl), under an overall space constraint
 (at least in winter).
 Bird settlement decisions for both winter and spring/summer seasons are
 the proximal causes of bird species composition in the reserve, rather
 than population dynamics.
 However, it would be incorrect to conclude that because the local compensation
 in winter that we found results from bird behaviour, it is disconnected
 from regional-scale community dynamics: which species are present in the
 reserve - safe from hunting - affects ultimately their survival and reproductiv
e success, which then feeds back into the regional-scale community dynamics.

Effect of the change in management on synchrony
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although we performed a first set of analyses using the whole time series,
 we have also performed seasonal analyses pre- and post-2006.
 The reason for these additional analyses is that a marked change in management
 occurred around 2006, after which the water levels were lower.
 Separating pre-/post-2006 and comparing to the previous analyses allows
 to disentangle the effect of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

normal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 dynamics from the effect of this management change.
 Pre- and post-2006 analyses showed very little differences with whole time
 series analyses for either the warm or cold season.
 However, in the wavelet modulus ratio analyses, we see at monthly or 5-year
 timescales more compensation after 2006 for waders.
 Since lower water levels
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Shouldn't we say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Since lower water levels are on average more appropriate...

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 might be a bit vague? Good point.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 are on average more appropriate for waders and their overall proportion
 has increased, it may be tempting to interpret this as a consequence of
 the community becoming saturated with waders.
 But we caution that it is difficult to make any strong conclusion on the
 effect of disturbances, which certainly depend on the particulars of both
 the disturbance and the community at hand, and have been varied in previous
 studies.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 showed that a disturbance (acidifiation of a lake) can synchronize a community,
 as predicted by theory.
 However, similar analyses on beetle communities by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "klink_functional_2019"

\end_inset

 found little effect of disturbances on synchrony patterns.
 In fact, they might have found a little less synchrony after disturbance,
 but the results were not clear cut.
 We now discuss a case where the biological processes at hand are better
 understood.

\begin_layout Subsection*
Synchrony in a small module with known competition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now zoom in on the cormorant-heron-egret module, for which we knew beforehand
 that competition for resting and roosting sites in the summer season occurs
 between, on the one hand, great cormorants, and on the other hand, little
 egrets and grey herons (C.
 Feigné, pers.
 obs.)

.
 Abundance time series suggested some negative correlation, but it was not
 found on the annual scale for which synchrony (or an absence of relation)
 dominates.
 Instead, we find that compensation mostly occurs above the annual temporal
 scale, approximatively on a scale of 8 years
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
F: I have a question there: is it really 6 years, not 8? Effectivement,

\end_layout

\end_inset

, much above the annual scale.
 This may indeed be a consequence of the slow shift in frequencies of cormorants
 and little egrets / grey herons.
 Compensation was also found episodically (for a given year) at shorter
 timescales (a few months).
 This may be a consequence of a greater difference between the periods during
 which each functional group is most abundant that year (i.e., a phenological
 mismatch).

Conclusion and perspectives for theory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall, our results suggest to search for compensation more often
\emph on
 between
\emph default
 rather than 
\emph on
within
\emph default
 functional groups, and over relatively long timescales, above the typical
 temporal autocorrelation of the dominant driver (e.g., above 5 years if the
 main driver is a seasonal climate).
 This rejoins the recent findings of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "klink_functional_2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 who found that increased functional differences between species tend to
 decrease synchrony in beetles, as well as earlier results of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "bai2004ecosystem"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 on negative covariation of plant functional groups.
 Our suggestion goes against calls to search for compensation within closely
 related species but at very short timescales 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "vasseur2007spectral,gonzalez2009causes"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, below the timescale of the main synchronizing seasonal environmental driver,
 in order to filter out precisely its synchronizing effect.
 Searching for compensation at temporal scales below the seasonal abiotic
 driver (e.g., temperature) was partly motivated by studies on plankton whose
 population dynamics are usually much faster than the dominant abiotic driver,
 with short generation times, so that the effects of competition may be
 manifest at the scale of a few weeks or months.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In theory, we could have expected compensation to manifest also at the smallest
 temporal scale of our survey (monthly).
 Indeed, the community dynamics in our case are driven by the movements
 and settlement decisions of birds, reacting to perceived food and space
 availability, rather than by births and deaths directly.
 Such behavioural dynamics can certainly be much faster than bird population
 dynamics, and could operate at the scale of weeks or months.
 However, such compensation due to short-term movements did not occur here.
 We suspect that instead, because many species share common abiotic and
 biotic drivers (e.g., disturbances due to nearby hunting, local climatic
 conditions) even below the seasonal timescale, their dynamics are bound
 to be synchronized to some degree at monthly temporal scales.
 It is noteworthy that even in planktonic systems, the temporal scale of
 compensation has often been found to be well above that of the forcing
 driver 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "keitt_coherent_2008,brown2016compensatory"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Thus our findings contribute to suggesting to search for compensation over
 relatively long timescales (several years for vertebrates or plants).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The attractor of community dynamics, i.e., the shape of community trajectories
 in phase space, seems to be more or less an annual cycle here: the dominant
 species fluctuate seasonally, but even though there are shifts in some
 species dynamics, no abundant species seem to exhibit violent multi-year
 oscillations.
 If we had to describe our community mathematically, a dynamical model with
 a stable fixed point forced by seasonality and some noise would probably
 be appropriate.
 This mild fluctuation scenario somehow contrasts with the dynamics of other
 communities, such as insect pests, that have quite often multi-year cycles
 (on top of seasonal cycles, for multivoltine species), with possibly strong
 indirect interactions between similar species mediated by predators and
 parasitoids 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "murdoch2003consumer"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In the latter context of internally-generated variability (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Endogenous compensatory cycles" in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "gonzalez2009causes"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), compensation is quite likely as well.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "klapwijk2018transient"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 recently reported only transient synchrony between species of moths, so
 that compensation could occur more frequently for more strongly oscillating
 species.
 Therefore, compensation could be more frequent for those groups at the
 yearly timescale.
 Whether or not these findings have some generality remains to be investigated
 by examining multi-species synchrony for more varied animal taxa.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In many ways, searching for abundance compensation using biodiversity time
 series data is searching for needles in a haystack: only some specific
 temporal and functional/taxonomic scales allow to see compensation whilst
 numerous confounding factors make the community co-vary positively at all
 other scales 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "vasseur_synchronous_2014"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Although the knowledge of specific biological mechanisms increasing the
 densities of some species at the expense of others can help, synchrony
 will likely dominate community-level time series data for closely related
 species, even in species that compete strongly 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ranta_detecting_2008,loreau_species_2008"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 This is true even in cases of known mechanisms of competition for space
 or shifts in community composition due to abiotic changes affecting differentia
lly species preferences, as in this study.
 We therefore suggest that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

zooming out
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 functionally (considering summed abundances of dissimilar functional groups)
 and temporally (considering temporal scales well above the periodicity
 of the dominant abiotic driver) may often be the best strategy to see the
 compensation that will inevitably manifest, if the community-level biomass
 is to be maintained within bounds in the long run.
