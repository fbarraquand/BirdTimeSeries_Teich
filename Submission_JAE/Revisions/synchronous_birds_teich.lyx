 in natural communities.
 This is a puzzle for ecologists, because of the key role of compensation
 to explain the relation between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.

2.
 However, most studies so far have considered compensation in either plants
 or planktonic organisms, so that evidence for the generality of such synchrony
 is limited.
 Here, we extend analyses of community-level synchrony to wetland birds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
3.
 Taking advantage of a monthly survey for 35 years, in a bird community
 where we suspected that compensation might occur - due to changes in water
 levels and known trends -, we perform both yearly and monthly analyses
 of community synchrony, applying yearly indices

\begin_layout Abstract
4.
 We find that compensatory dynamics are still rare, likely due to the synchroniz
ing influence of climate on birds, even after considering several temporal
 scales of covariation (during either cold or warm seasons, above or below
 the seasonal scale).
 Negative covariation in abundance at the whole community level did only
 appear after a management change in the reserve, and at the scale of a
 few months or several years.
 We also found that

 Although most research has focused on viewing compensation vs synchrony

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Density compensation occurs when individuals of a given species replace
 individuals of other species within a community, either because of explicit
 competitive processes or shifts in environmental drivers that change selection
 pressures 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gonzalez2009causes"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 The community as a whole then exhibits lower biomass variation than its
 constituent species 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gross2013species"
literal "true"

\end_inset

: some degree of compensation is therefore a prerequisite to stabilization
 at the community level

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\change_unchanged
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Understanding why environmental variation may lead to compensation is relatively
 easy,: if species have different environmental preference (e.g., thermal
 optima), and the environment changes over time, different species will
 be most fit at different points in time.
 As a consequence, relative abundances will shift over time even though
 the community biomass as a whole may remain relatively stable 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gonzalez2009causes"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 However, the conditions for compensation to happen also depend on the particula
rs of the interactions between and within species in the community.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Compensation is particularly likely to occur when such temporal environmental
 variation combines with a space or strongly limiting resource constraint,
 so that individuals are close to competing in a zero-sum game (sensu 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "hubbell2001unified"

\end_inset

 or lottery-style models, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "chesson_multispecies_1994"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 When the total community size is constant over time, and the composition
 fluctuates, negative covariation between abundances then emerges by design
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "loreau_species_2008"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 since no species can increase without another species decreasing in abundance.
 Outside of this zero-sum scenario, in models where Lotka-Volterra competition
 is combined with temporal environmental variability, theoretical research
 has revealed that increased interspecific competition might not increase
 species compensation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ives_stability_1999"
literal "false"

\end_inset

and might even decrease it 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
before "i.e., increase species synchrony instead,"
key "loreau_species_2008"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, though this depends on the fluctuation regime.
 Thus, in a world where total community size varies, predicting whether
 compensatory (asynchronous) dynamics can occur is intrinsically difficult

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Early investigations of the frequency of synchronous vs compensatory dynamics
 focused on the variance ratio, that is, the variance of the sum of the
 community biomass divided by the sum of the variance of the component species
 biomasses 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "houlahan_compensatory_2007,gonzalez2009causes"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Unfortunately, this metric is not appropriate for communities subjected
 to community-wide environmental forcing 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ranta_detecting_2008"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, because a main environmental driver (e.g., temperature or light) may synchronize
 species abundances or growth rates at some scale, creating large variance
 in community-wide biomass, in spite of strongly competitive dynamics.
 Further research has therefore focused on specific timeframes during which
 compensatory dynamics may be found (e.g., below the seasonal scale at which
 temperature fluctuations tend to synchronize species dynamics, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "vasseur_synchronous_2014"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite efforts to look for more meaningful temporal scales in community-level
 time series, temporal compensation has remained surprinsingly elusive in
 the field

), in a natural reserve, allowing us to dig deeper into patterns of synchrony,
 at several temporal and taxonomic or functional scales.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed, taxonomic and functional scales should be main modulators of synchrony/c
ompensation.
 On the one hand, 
\change_deleted -2100369821 1567431811
 
\change_unchanged
compensation can be high between similar and closely related species.
 If two species of ducks A and B share almost the same niche, individualsfrom
 either species experience similar competition from species A or B, and
 should feel the effects of other species in the community identically.
 This tends to favor priority effects 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "fukami_historical_2015"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, with chance due to movement events determining whether species A or B
 locally dominates, which can then provide compensation at the landscape
 level 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "loreau2003biodiversity"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 On the other hand, it could be argued that these two similar duck species
 will precisely respond in similar ways to environmental variables, which
 tends to obfuscate compensation.
 Under the latter scenario, more dissimilar species or groups (within the
 same trophic level nonetheless) could exhibit compensation

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "klink_functional_2019"

\end_inset


\change_unchanged
.
 This can occur because more dissimilar species are more likely to have
 different environmental preferences and the environment varies over time
 (e.g., groups of species preferring more open vs more closed habitats replacing
 each other as a function of changes in vegetation height).
 Surprisingly, such compensation

between

 guilds has been less well explored than within guilds, even though there
 is actually some empirical evidence for compensation between dissimilar

 In this paper, we explore the level of compensation/synchrony within or
 between guilds, along either taxonomic or functional classifications.
 Although a functional classification might appear intuitively more appealing,
 our knowledge of functional traits isnecessarily partial and imperfect,
 so that a taxonomic description can sometimes be preferable

\begin_layout Standard
Our objective is therefore to examine how synchronous or compensatory bird
 communities are at different temporal and taxonomic (or functional) scales.
 Our dataset is ideally suited to the task given that (i) it is a highly
 temporally resolved time series with respect to the species typical generation
 times, but it also extends well beyond generation time (35 years) and (ii)
 the reserve where the data has been collected was subjected to a major
 management change c.
 2006 (change in water levels), favoring different types of wetland birds
 (so that over long timescales, there is a real potential for changes in
 community composition).

\begin_layout Standard
The monthly time series used for the statistical analyses have been collected
 at the Teich Ornithological Reserve, Arcachon Bay, France (44.64°N / -1.02°E),
 by the staff of the Teich reserve, over the whole study period.
 The reserve comprises 120 ha of wetlands, and the counts have been aggregated
 at the reserve scale (summed over 18
\begin_inset Note Note
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 sectors where the counts are actually performed, using binoculars).
 We use for each species the maximum observed abundance over a month, which
 provides a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

monthly snapshot
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the bird abundance, that has been used to monitor the reserve since
 its inception.
 When abundance values are missing for certain species and months, we replace
 them by 0s.
 Given the sustained observation effort (all sectors are patrolled multiple
 times throughout the month by the staff, amateur ornithologists visiting
 the reserve daily and signalling their findings to the reserve staff),
 we consider that the absence of counts for a given species signals its
 true absence from the reserve.
 This creates some zero abundances for rare species at the monthly scale.
 We have not attempted to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

correct
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 those zeroes (e.g., inferring the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

missing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 data with a model assuming that our reserve is a subsample of a regional
 population) because doing so would have compromised the patterns of local
 synchrony/compensation.
 However, we did check below that having such zeroes in the monthly time
 series cannot affect our conclusions

 In the statistical analyses, we use seasonally averaged abundances (plotted

Appendix S1).
 We defined two seasons based on observations of bird presence.
 We defined a `warm season', from May to August, and a `cold season' as
 the months between November and February of the following year.
 From an ecological viewpoint, this seasonal classification separates wintering
 birds from summer residents (some of whom are breeding).
 This makes sense biologically because the two communities have different
 requirements and respond differentially to abiotic drivers.
 It is also useful from a more statistical perspective, as there is a shift
 in composition between the seasons, though winter and summer communities
 partially overlap due to a number of shared species.

 Waders and ducks have different environmental preferences, with ducks preferrin

 mudflats.
 
\change_deleted -666822487 1568133805
We chose to work at two slightly different taxonomic levels to compare similarly
 sized groups.
 
\change_inserted -666822487 1568134722
A list of all birds found frequently in the reserve is presented in SI Appendix

 egrets and cormorants (see below).
 Among the fish eaters, grebes and gulls we also found to be present; a

 This synchrony index described in eq.

 That is, we constructed two community-level time series where each year
 is associated to a vector of species abundances, one for the cold season
 and one for warm season.
 To do so, we averaged monthly bird abundances, for each species, over the
 season duration.
 We then computed the synchrony index for both cold and warm seasons using
 the year as our statistical unit.
 In follow-up analyses, we also differentiated periods before and after
 2006, given that a management change occurred within the reserve in 2006.
 We considered both the synchrony inside a given group (e.g., among species

 The challenge to construct such null hypothesis is to remove all cross-correlat

 Therefore, for each set of time series (each combination year

 season for a given community), we constructed 100 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 Within communities, we shifted the time-series 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "purves_fine-scale_2002"

\end_inset

 while between communities, we used a frequency-based approach (Iterated
 Amplitude-Adjusted Fourier Transform or IAAFT, see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "schreiber_surrogate_2000"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 We first explain the shift-based approach: the suite of abundance values
 (after seasonal averaging) is displaced by a random temporal lag 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, so that a value 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}$
\end_inset

 is now found at 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t+\tau}$
\end_inset

.
 At the boundary (the end of the time series), remaining points are displaced
 towards the beginning of the time-series, which implements a
\change_inserted -666822487 1568134194
 
\change_unchanged
toroidal shift.
 This methods works well 
\change_deleted -666822487 1568134211
with
\change_inserted -666822487 1568134213
when comparing

 many times series
\change_inserted -666822487 1568134223
 corresponding to the multiple species
\change_unchanged
.
 However, when 
\change_deleted -666822487 1568134253
there were 
\change_inserted -666822487 1568134264

\change_unchanged
, 
\change_deleted -666822487 1568134277
when the synchrony index is computed between communities)
\change_unchanged
, spurious cross-correlations could emerge
\change_inserted -666822487 1568188443
 with a shift-based approach as the number of possible combinations is more
 limited
\change_unchanged
.
 Therefore, to test for synchrony between 
\change_inserted -666822487 1568134356
the

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, which retains the frequency spectrum of the time series while randomizing
 its values.
 We obtained 100 sets of randomized time series for each computed synchrony
 index.
 We then compared the number of 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{H0}$
\end_inset

 values which exceeded or were inferior to the observed value to compute
 the p-value according to

 (
\change_inserted -666822487 1568134480
i.e.,

 where

 is the number of surrogate values that are

\end_inset

 (respectively 
\begin_inset Formula $\le\eta_{obs}$

\begin_inset Formula $n$

 is the number of surrogates).
 Independence of species was rejected at the 10% threshold with a Benjamini-Hoch
berg correction, as we compare across 2 seasons and 3 periods, with partially
 overlapping data.

\change_inserted -666822487 1568138969
 This was found satisfactory based on simulated data, although power is
 low for detecting compensation (i.e., the null cannot always be rejected)
 when only two groups are compared.

In addition to the time-domain analyses above, we performed frequency-domain
 analyses for a range of temporal scales ranging from a few months to years.
 This was done in particular for analyzing synchrony within the rich wader
 community, as well as the group formed by the great cormorant, grey heron
 and little egret.All wavelet analyses take as input the monthly time series
 data.
 Based on the work by

 and follow-up by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda_{t,s}(\centerdot)=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{t-\tau}{s})^{2}}(\centerdot)d\tau$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $|\centerdot|$
\end_inset

 is the modulus of the complex number.
 The numerator corresponds to the total biomass variation while the denominator
 corresponds to the variations of each species.
 This index is close to 0 when species compensate and reaches 1 when they
 are synchronous.
 As before, the significance of each value was tested at the 10%, Benjamini-Hoch
berg corrected, threshold by 100 phase-randomizations of each species time
 series, and computation of the corresponding

\end_inset

 values.

 The robustness of the wavelet approach to the presence of exactly zero

Even though there is no widespread community-wide or genus-wide compensation
 at the yearly timescale (differentiating the seasons), there could be compensat
ion at finer temporal scales, e.g.
 a month or two, or coarser scales, over several years.

There are therefore relatively contrasted results regarding the effect of
 the management change on short-term synchrony within the wader community.
 At the yearly (season) timescale, it seems to increase the synchrony (though
 the Gross index and wavelets provide slightly different answers).
 At even shorter timescales though, it seems to decrease it.

 There might be some compensation over very short timescale as well (within

 this are unclear, since these species compete for roost sites, a process
 that it unlikely to manifest at such very short timescales.

 However, we found that if two groups respond in opposite ways to a shared
 driver, the stronger the response to the driver, the lesser the compensation
 indicated by 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$

 at the whole community level.
 This might explain the low levels of compensation that we found at the
 overall wetland bird community level (Appendix S2), in spite of the clear
 presence of two groups

 Analyses at several taxonomic/functional scales are therefore warranted
 to be conclusive about compensation.

waders and ducks were found to correlate negatively only during the cold

 This
\change_deleted -666822487 1568137653
 may be because 
\change_inserted -666822487 1568137658
can be explained 
\change_deleted -666822487 1568137662

) might be due to an increased inflow of birds preferring low water levels,
 and outflow of birds preferring high water levels, under an overall space
 constraint.
 In other words, the shift in community dynamics is likely not directly
 due to birth and deaths.
 However, it would be incorrect to conclude that such local compensation
 is disconnected from regional-scale community dynamics: which species are
 present in the reserve affects their reproductive success, which feeds
 back into regional-scale dynamics, and in turn, regional-scale dynamics
 influences which species are locally settling and competing.

Effect of the change in management on synchrony
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\change_inserted -666822487 1568190018
Although we performed analyses throughout the whole time series, in which
 there is a progressive change in composition (Appendix S1), a marked change
 in management occured around 2006, after which the water levels were kept
 at a lower level.
 We have therefore also performed yearly analyses pre- and post-2006.
 These showed very little differences during either the warm or cold season.
 However, in the wavelet analyses, we clearly see at monthly or multi-year
 timescales more compensation after 2006.
 Since the water levels are on average more appropriate for waders and their
 overall proportion has increased, it may be tempting to interpret this
 as a consequence of the community becoming saturated with waders, but we
 caution that it is difficult to make any strong conclusion based on a single
 synchrony index.
 We now describe a case where the biological processes at hand are better
 understood.

Zooming in on the cormorant-heron-egret module, 
\change_inserted -666822487 1568189839
for which we knew beforehand that competition for resting/roosting sites
 in the summer season occurs between on the one hand, cormorants, and on
 the other hand, little egrets and gre herons (C.
 Feigné, pers.
 obs.).
 Abundance time series suggested some negative correlation, but it was not
 found on the annual scale for which synchrony (or an absence of relation)
 dominates.
 Instead, 
\change_unchanged
we find that compensation mostly occurs above the annual temporal scale
\change_inserted -666822487 1568189839
, approximatively on a scale of 6 years, much above the annual scale.
 
\change_deleted -666822487 1568137855
, and predominantly in summer as well as before 2006
\change_unchanged
.
 
\change_deleted -666822487 1568137928
This occurs because of a slow replacement of species due to competition
 for resting/roosting sites in the summer season (C.
 Feigné, pers.

\change_inserted -666822487 1568189903
 This may indeed be a consequence of the slow shift in frequencies cormorants
 and little egrets / grey herons.

\begin_layout Subsection*

\change_inserted -666822487 1568189927
Conclusion and perspectives for theory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall, our results suggest to search for compensation more often
\emph on
 between
\emph default
 rather than 
\emph on
within
\emph default
 functional groups, and over relatively long timescales, above the typical
 temporal autocorrelation of the dominant driver (e.g., above 5 years if the
 main driver is a seasonal climate).
 This goes against calls to search for compensation at very short timescales
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "vasseur2007spectral,gonzalez2009causes"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, below the timescale of the main synchronizing seasonal environmental driver,
 in order to filter out its synchronizing effect.
 Although searching for compensation at temporal scales below the seasonal
 abiotic driver (e.g., temperature) was partly motivated by studies on plankton
 whose community dynamics are much faster, with much shorter generation
 times, we could have expected compensation to manifest also that scale
 here as well (e.g., monthly).
 Indeed, movement of birds reacting to food availability can certainly occur
 within the season, and wetlands have a finite carrying capacity, so that
 there is competition for space, which could promote short-term compensation.
 We suspect that instead, because many species share common abiotic and
 biotic drivers (e.g., disturbances due to nearby hunting) even below the
 yearly timescale, their dynamics are bound to be synchronized to some degree
 even below the yearly scale.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The attractor of community dynamics, i.e., the shape of community trajectories
 in phase space, seems to be more or less an annual cycle here: the dominant
 species fluctuate seasonally, but even though there are shifts in some
 species dynamics, no abundant species seem to exhibit violent multi-year
 oscillations.
 If we had to describe our community mathematically, a dynamical model with
 a stable fixed point forced by seasonality and some noise would probably
 work nicely.
 This mild fluctuation scenario somehow constrasts with the dynamics of
 other communities, such as insect pests, that have quite often multi-year
 cycles (on top of seasonal cycles, for multivoltine species), with possibly
 strong indirect interactions between similar species mediated by predators
 and parasitoids 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "murdoch2003consumer"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In this latter context of internally-generated variability ("Endogenous
 compensatory cycles" in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "gonzalez2009causes"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), compensation is quite likely as well.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "klapwijk2018transient"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 recently reported only transient synchrony between species of moths, so
 that compensation could occur more frequently for more strongly oscillating
 species.
 Therefore, compensation could be more likely for those groups at the yearly
 timescale.
 Whether or not these findings have some generality remains to be investigated
 by examining multi-species synchrony for more varied animal taxa.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In many ways, searching for compensation using biodiversity time series
 data is searching for needles in a haystack: only some specific temporal
 and functional/taxonomic scales allow to see compensation whilst numerous
 confounding factors make the community co-vary positively at all other
 scales 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "vasseur_synchronous_2014"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Although the knowledge of specific biological mechanisms increasing the
 densities of some species at the expense of others can help, synchrony
 will likely dominate community-level time series data for closely related
 species, even in species that compete strongly 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ranta_detecting_2008,loreau_species_2008"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 This is true even in cases of known mechanisms of competition for space
 or shifts in community composition due to abiotic changes affecting differentia
lly species preferences, as in this study.
 We therefore suggest that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

zooming out
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 taxonomically or functionally (considering summed abondances of dissimilar
 functional groups) and temporally (considering temporal scales well above
 the periodicity of the dominant abiotic driver) may often be the best strategy
 to see the compensation that will inevitably manifest if the community-level
 biomass is to be maintained within bounds.
