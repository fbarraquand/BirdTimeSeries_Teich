\begin_layout Abstract
1.
 Compensatory dynamics, during which community composition shifts despite
 a near-constant total community size, are usually rare: synchronous dynamics
 prevail in natural communities.
 This is a puzzle for ecologists, because of the key role of compensation
 to explain the relation between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
2.
 However, most studies so far have considered compensation in either plants
 or planktonic organisms, so that evidence for the generality of such synchrony
 is limited.
 Here, we extend analyses of community-level synchrony to wetland birds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
3.
 Taking advantage of a monthly survey for 35 years, in a bird community
 where we suspected that compensation might occur - due to changes in water
 levels and known trends -, we perform both yearly and monthly analyses
 of community synchrony, applying yearly indices and wavelet-based synchrony
 measures to time series.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
4.
 We find that compensatory dynamics are still rare, likely due to the synchroniz
ing influence of climate on birds, even after considering several temporal
 scales of covariation (during either cold or warm seasons, above or below
 the seasonal scale).
 Negative covariation in abundance at the whole community level did only
 appear after a management change in the reserve, and at the scale of a
 few months or several years.
 We also found that compensation varies with taxonomic and functional scale:
 compensation appeared more frequently 
\emph on
between
\emph default
 rather than 
\emph on
within

 guilds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
5.
 Although most research has focused on viewing compensation vs synchrony
 across temporal scales, because synchrony is guaranteed by environmental
 forcing at some temporal scales, our results suggest that compensation
 can be masked as well at some taxonomic scales (e.g., when measuring synchrony
 only at the species level).
 We suggest that compensation may have more potential to emerge between
 broad taxonomic units or functional groups, rather between species

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Density compensation occurs when individuals of a given species replace
 individuals of other species within a community, either because of explicit
 competitive processes or shifts in environmental drivers that change selection
 pressures 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gonzalez2009causes"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 The community as a whole then exhibits lower biomass variation than its
 constituent species 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gross2013species"
literal "true"

\end_inset

: some degree of compensation is therefore a prerequisite to stabilization
 at the community level (Loreau and De Mazancourt 2013 –

]).
\change_unchanged

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Understanding why environmental variation may lead to compensation is relatively
 easy,: if species have different environmental preference (e.g., thermal
 optima), and the environment changes over time, different species will
 be most fit at different points in time.
 As a consequence, relative abundances will shift over time even though
 the community biomass as a whole may remain relatively stable 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gonzalez2009causes"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 However, the conditions for compensation to happen also depend on the particula
rs of the interactions between and within species in the community.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Compensation is particularly likely to occur when such temporal environmental
 variation combines with a space or strongly limiting resource constraint,
 so that individuals are close to competing in a zero-sum game (sensu 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "hubbell2001unified"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 or lottery-style models, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "chesson_multispecies_1994"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 When the total community size is constant over time, and the composition
 fluctuates, negative covariation between abundances then emerges by design
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "loreau_species_2008"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 since no species can increase without another species decreasing in abundance.
 Outside of this zero-sum scenario, in models where Lotka-Volterra competition
 is combined with temporal environmental variability, theoretical research
 has revealed that increased interspecific competition might not increase
 species compensation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ives_stability_1999"
literal "false"

\end_inset

and might even decrease it 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
before "i.e., increase species synchrony instead,"
key "loreau_species_2008"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, though this depends on the fluctuation regime.
 Thus, in a world where total community size varies, predicting whether
 compensatory (asynchronous) dynamics can occur is intrinsically difficult

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Early investigations of the frequency of synchronous vs compensatory dynamics
 focused on the variance ratio, that is, the variance of the sum of the
 community biomass divided by the sum of the variance of the component species
 biomasses 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "houlahan_compensatory_2007,gonzalez2009causes"

\end_inset

.
 Unfortunately, this metric is not appropriate for communities subjected
 to community-wide environmental forcing 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ranta_detecting_2008"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, because a main environmental driver (e.g., temperature or light) may synchronize
 species abundances or growth rates at some scale, creating large variance
 in community-wide biomass, in spite of strongly competitive dynamics.
 Further research has therefore focused on specific timeframes during which
 compensatory dynamics may be found (e.g., below the seasonal scale at which
 temperature fluctuations tend to synchronize species dynamics,

Despite efforts to look for more meaningful temporal scales in community-level
 time series, temporal compensation has remained surprinsingly elusive in

), in a natural reserve, allowing us to dig deeper into patterns of synchrony,
 at several temporal and taxonomic or functional scales.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed, taxonomic and functional scales should be main modulators of synchrony/c
ompensation.
 On the one hand, 
\change_deleted -2100369821 1567431811
 
\change_unchanged
compensation can be high between similar and closely related species.
 If two species of ducks A and B share almost the same niche, individualsfrom
 either species experience similar competition from species A or B, and
 should feel the effects of other species in the community identically.
 This tends to favor priority effects 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "fukami_historical_2015"

\end_inset

, with chance due to movement events determining whether species A or B
 locally dominates, which can then provide compensation at the landscape
 level 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "loreau2003biodiversity"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 On the other hand, it could be argued that these two similar duck species
 will precisely respond in similar ways to environmental variables, which
 tends to obfuscate compensation.
 Under the latter scenario, more dissimilar species or groups (within the
 same trophic level nonetheless) could exhibit compensation

 This can occur because more dissimilar species are more likely to have
 different environmental preferences and the environment varies over time
 (e.g., groups of species preferring more open vs more closed habitats replacing
 each other as a function of changes in vegetation height).
 Surprisingly, such compensation

Our objective is therefore to examine how synchronous or compensatory bird
 communities are at different temporal and taxonomic (or functional) scales.
 Our dataset is ideally suited to the task given that (i) it is a highly
 temporally resolved time series with respect to the species typical generation
 times, but it also extends well beyond generation time (35 years) and (ii)
 the reserve where the data has been collected was subjected to a major
 management change c.

\begin_layout Standard
The monthly time series used for the statistical analyses have been collected
 at the Teich Ornithological Reserve, Arcachon Bay, France (44.64°N / -1.02°E),
 by the staff of the Teich reserve, over the whole study period.
 The reserve comprises 120 ha of wetlands, and the counts have been aggregated
 at the reserve scale (summed over 18

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 sectors where the counts are actually performed, using binoculars).
 We use for each species the maximum observed abundance over a month, which
 provides a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

monthly snapshot
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the bird abundance, that has been used to monitor the reserve since
 its inception.
 When abundance values are missing for certain species and months, we replace
 them by 0s.
 Given the sustained observation effort (all sectors are patrolled multiple
 times throughout the month by the staff, amateur ornithologists visiting
 the reserve daily and signalling their findings to the reserve staff),
 we consider that the absence of counts for a given species signals its
 true absence from the reserve.
 This creates some zero abundances for rare species at the monthly scale.
 We have not attempted to

 those zeroes (e.g., inferring the

 data with a model assuming that our reserve is a subsample of a regional
 population) because doing so would have compromised the patterns of local
 synchrony/compensation.
 However, we did check below that having such zeroes in the monthly time
 series cannot affect our conclusions

 We defined two seasons based on observations of bird presence.
 We defined a `warm season', from May to August, and a `cold season' as
 the months between November and February of the following year.
 From an ecological viewpoint, this seasonal classification separates wintering
 birds from summer residents (some of whom are breeding).
 This makes sense biologically because the two communities have different
 requirements and respond differentially to abiotic drivers.
 It is also useful from a more statistical perspective, as there is a shift
 in composition between the seasons, though winter and summer communities
 partially overlap due to a number of shared species.

 is the abundance or biomass of species

 This synchrony index described in eq.

 Contrary to other indices (e.g.,

 That is, we constructed two community-level time series where each year
 is associated to a vector of species abundances, one for the cold season
 and one for warm season.
 To do so, we averaged monthly bird abundances, for each species, over the
 season duration.
 We then computed the synchrony index for both cold and warm seasons using
 the year as our statistical unit.
 In follow-up analyses, we also differentiated periods before and after
 2006, given that a management change occurred within the reserve in 2006.
 We considered both the synchrony inside a given group (e.g., among species
 of the 
\shape italic
Anas
\shape default
 genus) or between groups (e.g., between the summed abundances of the 9 species
 of genus 
\shape italic
Anas
\shape default
 and
\emph on
 
\shape italic
the sum of the 12

 In the latter case of between-groups comparisons, we summed species together
 before seasonal averaging, to consider seasonal averages of the monthly
 group density.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We computed the statistical significance of the synchrony index by comparing
 the observed values to the distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 under the null hypothesis 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gouhier_synchrony_2014"
literal "true"

\end_inset

,which amounts to zero cross-correlations between species or groups of species.
 The challenge to construct such null hypothesis is to remove all cross-correlat
ions while keeping the exact same autocorrelation in each individual time
 series.
 Therefore, for each set of time series (each combination year 
\begin_inset Formula $\times$
\end_inset

 season for a given community), we constructed 100 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

surrogates
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in which we kept the auto-correlation within observations, but removed
 the cross-correlation between time series.
 There are multiple ways to erase the cross-correlation depending on the
 resolution of the considered community.
 Within communities, we shifted the time-series 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "purves_fine-scale_2002"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 while between communities, we used a frequency-based approach (Iterated
 Amplitude-Adjusted Fourier Transform or IAAFT, see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "schreiber_surrogate_2000"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 We first explain the shift-based approach: the suite of abundance values
 (after seasonal averaging) is displaced by a 
\change_deleted -2100369821 1564070540
 
\change_unchanged
random temporal lag 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, so that a value 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}$
\end_inset

 is now found at 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t+\tau}$
\end_inset

.
 At the boundary (the end of the time series), remaining points are displaced
 towards the beginning of the time-series, which implements atoroidal shift.
 This methods works well with many times series.
 However, when there were only few time series e.g., two groups, when the
 synchrony index is computed between communities), spurious cross-correlations
 could emerge.
 Therefore, to test for synchrony between summed abundances of each guild
 or taxonomic unit, we used the more refined IAAFT method 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "schreiber_surrogate_2000"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, which retains the frequency spectrum of the time series while randomizing
 its values.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We obtained 100 sets of randomized time series for each computed synchrony
 index.
 We then compared the number of

 the p-value according to

 Independence of species was rejected at the 10% threshold with a Benjamini-Hoch

Using a taxonomic classification of the community (

\shape italic

 as two key examples of contrasted birds), we can see that within-genus
 synchrony indices at the seasonal scale are always positive whenever significan
tly different from the null hypothesis (no temporal correlation between
 species), i.e.
 there is no compensation within a genus (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).
 This matches the patterns obtained within the entire wetland bird community
 (Fig A1 in Appendix 1).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the cold season, 
\shape italic
Calidris
\shape default
 and 
\shape italic
Anas
\shape default
 exhibit opposite trends in synchrony in response to the management change
 in 2006.
 However, for the warm season, the management change, which consisted in
 lowering the water levels, created more synchronous communities of species
 within the 
\emph on
Anas
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
Calidris
\emph default
 genera.
 This increase in synchrony after 2006 is matched by the functional group
 classification.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though there is no widespread community-wide or genus-wide compensation
 at the yearly timescale (differentiating the seasons), there could be compensat
ion at finer temporal scales, e.g.
 a month or two, or coarser scales, over several years.
 When we consider the wavelet plot (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Wavelet-modulus-ratio"

caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), that is a time-varying and scale-dependent strength of synchrony, we
 can see that there is synchrony even at a fine temporal scale throughout
 most of the time series.
 However, post-2006, there seems to be a possibility for overcompensation
 on a scale around 5 years or around 3-4 months.

There are therefore relatively contrasted results regarding the effect of
 the management change on short-term synchrony within the wader community.
 At the yearly (season) timescale, it seems to increase the synchrony (though
 the Gross index and wavelets provide slightly different answers).
 At even shorter timescales though, it seems to decrease it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More clear-cut results can be found when we examine the synchrony vs compensatio
n between functional groups (Fig.
 2d).
 Since we consider only two functional groups, the Gross index reduces to
 a simple correlation.
 Waders and ducks are negatively correlated during the cold season and positivel
y correlated during the warm season.
 These patterns are in contrast unclear when using a taxonomic classification
 (no compensation, Fig.
 2c).

 that synchrony is in fact the rule around the annual scale and below, when

 We wondered if the patterns in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 were caused by the use of a log scale, but we found that in fact the correlatio
n was higher rather than lower on the log scale (Appendix 2).
 However, over long temporal scales (
\begin_inset Formula $\sim$
\end_inset

 6 years) there seems to be some compensation, which may indicate a progressive
 change in composition within this small community module, that was already
 visible on the time series plot (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Time-series-of"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

).
 There might be some compensation over very short timescale as well (within
 the season), but at very specific times and the biological mechanisms for
 this are unclear, since these species compete for roost sites, a process
 that it unlikely to manifest at such very short timescales.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Compensation was overall very rare at the yearly timescale (differentiating
 between the cold and warm season).
 At short timescales (below the season), and among taxonomically or functionally
 close species, some compensation could be found but only at certain periods.
 In other words, there was no widespread 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

functional compensation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (

) 
\emph on
within
\emph default
 genera or guilds at the annual scale or below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yet, summing species abundances within a guild and comparing the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

biomass sums
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of contrasted guilds, community composition did change in frequency in
 the long run; in other words, there was some compensation 
\emph on
between
\emph default
 guilds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given that we compare the level of synchrony/compensation within guilds
 (with many species) and between guilds (with only a handful of groups),
 we checked in Appendix S4 if changing the number of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

compartments
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

) in the Gross 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 index could affect its value: it did not.
 However, we found that if two groups respond in opposite ways to a shared
 driver, the stronger the response to the driver, the lesser the compensation
 indicated by 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 at the whole community level.
 This might explain the low levels of compensation that we found at the
 overall wetland bird community level (Appendix S2), in spite of the clear
 presence of two groups reacting in opposite way to shared driver (here,
 water levels).
 Analyses at several taxonomic/functional scales are therefore warranted
 to be conclusive about compensation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We used correlation between the summed abundances of closely related species
 (species within the 
\shape italic
Anas
\shape default
 genus vs species within the 
\shape italic
Calidris
\shape default
 genus) or the summed abundances of functionally similar species (waders
 vs ducks) to uncover compensation.
 The functional group classification produced much more clearly compensation
 between guilds than the taxonomic classification.
 We expected to see compensation at that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

functional scale
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 irrespective of the season, because the requirements of these birds are
 different, but here waders and ducks were found to correlate negatively
 only during the cold (wintering) season.
 This may be because the summer is characterized by a broad inflow of birds,
 including non-resident individuals that somehow add random variation to
 the community dynamics (though other explanations are possible).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It may be better to say that we detected 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

compensation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 rather than 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

compensatory dynamics
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 between bird species 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gonzalez2009causes"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 as the observed long-term changes in species composition (more waders,
 proportionally less ducks; Appendix 4) might be due to an increased inflow
 of birds preferring low water levels, and outflow of birds preferring high
 water levels, under an overall space constraint.
 In other words, the shift in community dynamics is likely not directly
 due to birth and deaths.
 However, it would be incorrect to conclude that such local compensation
 is disconnected from regional-scale community dynamics: which species are
 present in the reserve affects their reproductive success, which feeds
 back into regional-scale dynamics, and in turn, regional-scale dynamics
 influences which species are locally settling and competing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zooming in on the cormorant-heron-egret module, we find that compensation
 mostly occurs above the annual temporal scale, and predominantly in summer
 as well as before 2006.
 This occurs because of a slow replacement of species due to competition
 for resting/roosting sites in the summer season (C.
 Feigné, pers.
 obs.), which mostly occurred before 2006.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall, our results suggest to search for compensation more often
\emph on
 between
\emph default
 rather than 
\emph on
within
\emph default
 functional groups, and over relatively long timescales, above the typical
 temporal autocorrelation of the dominant driver (e.g., above 5 years if the
 main driver is a seasonal climate).
 This goes against calls to search for compensation at very short timescales
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "vasseur2007spectral,gonzalez2009causes"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, below the timescale of the main synchronizing seasonal environmental driver,
 in order to filter out its synchronizing effect.
 Although searching for compensation at temporal scales below the seasonal
 abiotic driver (e.g., temperature) was partly motivated by studies on plankton
 whose community dynamics are much faster, with much shorter generation
 times, we could have expected compensation to manifest also that scale
 here as well (e.g., monthly).
 Indeed, movement of birds reacting to food availability can certainly occur
 within the season, and wetlands have a finite carrying capacity, so that
 there is competition for space, which could promote short-term compensation.
 We suspect that instead, because many species share common abiotic and
 biotic drivers (e.g., disturbances due to nearby hunting) even below the
 yearly timescale, their dynamics are bound to be synchronized to some degree
 even below the yearly scale.

\begin_layout Standard
The attractor of community dynamics, i.e., the shape of community trajectories
 in phase space, seems to be more or less an annual cycle here: the dominant
 species fluctuate seasonally, but even though there are shifts in some
 species dynamics, no abundant species seem to exhibit violent multi-year
 oscillations.
 If we had to describe our community mathematically, a dynamical model with
 a stable fixed point forced by seasonality and some noise would probably
 work nicely.
 This mild fluctuation scenario somehow constrasts with the dynamics of
 other communities, such as insect pests, that have quite often multi-year
 cycles (on top of seasonal cycles, for multivoltine species), with possibly
 strong indirect interactions between similar species mediated by predators
 and parasitoids

 In this latter context of internally-generated variability ("Endogenous
 compensatory cycles" in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

), compensation is quite likely as well.

 recently reported only transient synchrony between species of moths, so
 that compensation could occur more frequently for more strongly oscillating
 species.
 Therefore, compensation could be more likely for those groups at the yearly
 timescale.
 Whether or not these findings have some generality remains to be investigated
 by examining multi-species synchrony for more varied animal taxa.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In many ways, searching for compensation using biodiversity time series
 data is searching for needles in a haystack: only some specific temporal
 and functional/taxonomic scales allow to see compensation whilst numerous
 confounding factors make the community co-vary positively at all other
 scales

 Although the knowledge of specific biological mechanisms increasing the
 densities of some species at the expense of others can help, synchrony
 will likely dominate community-level time series data for closely related
 species, even in species that compete strongly

 This is true even in cases of known mechanisms of competition for space
 or shifts in community composition due to abiotic changes affecting differentia
lly species preferences, as in this study.
 We therefore suggest that

 taxonomically or functionally (considering summed abondances of dissimilar
 functional groups) and temporally (considering temporal scales well above
 the periodicity of the dominant abiotic driver) may often be the best strategy
 to see the compensation that will inevitably manifest if the community-level
 biomass is to be maintained within bounds.
