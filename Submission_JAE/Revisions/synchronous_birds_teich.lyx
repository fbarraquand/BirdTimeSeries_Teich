 This is a puzzle for ecologists, because of the key role of compensation
 to explain the relation between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.

 However, most studies so far have considered compensation in either plants
 or planktonic organisms, so that evidence for the generality of such synchrony
 is limited.
 Here, we extend analyses of community-level synchrony to wetland birds.

 We analyse a 35-year monthly survey of a

 in water levels, favouring birds with different habitat preferences, and
 potential competition.
 We perform both yearly analyses by season, using a synchrony index, and
 monthly analyses using wavelet-based measures allowing for scale-dependence.
 We

\begin_layout Abstract
4.
 We find that abundance compensation is rare, likely due to the synchronizing
 influence of climate on birds, even after considering several temporal
 scales of covariation (during either cold or warm seasons, above or below
 the seasonal scale).
 Negative covariation in abundance at the whole community level did only
 appear after a management change in the reserve, and at the scale of a
 few months or several years.
 We also found that synchrony varies with taxonomic and functional scale:
 the rare cases where compensation appeared more consistently at the annual
 scale were 
\emph on
between
\emph default
 rather than 
\emph on
within
\emph default
 guilds, using functional groups.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
5.
 Although most research has focused on viewing compensation vs synchrony
 across temporal scales, because synchrony is guaranteed at the temporal
 scale of the dominant environmental forcing, our results suggest that compensat
ion can be masked as well at some taxonomic or functional scales.
 We suggest that abundance compensation may have more potential to emerge
 between broad functional groups, rather between species.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Density compensation occurs when individuals of a given species replace
 individuals of other species within a community, either because of explicit
 competitive processes or shifts in environmental drivers that change selection
 pressures 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gonzalez2009causes"

\end_inset

.
 The community as a whole then exhibits lower biomass variation than its
 constituent species 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gross2013species"
literal "true"

\end_inset

: some degree of compensation or asynchrony is therefore a prerequisite
 to stabilization at the community level 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Understanding why environmental variation may lead to compensation is relatively
 easy
\change_deleted -2100369821 1573052053
,
\change_unchanged
: if species have different environmental preference
\change_inserted -2100369821 1573052068
s
\change_unchanged
 (e.g., thermal optima), and the environment changes over time, different
 species will be most fit at different points in time.
 As a consequence, relative abundances will shift over time even though
 the community biomass as a whole may remain relatively stable 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gonzalez2009causes"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 However, the conditions for compensation to happen also depend on the particula
rs of the interactions between and within species in the community.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Compensation is particularly likely to occur when such temporal environmental
 variation combines with a space or strongly limiting resource constraint,
 so that individuals are close to competing in a zero-sum game (sensu 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 or lottery-style models, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "chesson_multispecies_1994"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 When the total community size is constant over time, and the composition
 fluctuates, negative covariation between abundances then emerges by design
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "loreau_species_2008"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 since no species can increase without another species decreasing in abundance.
 Outside of this zero-sum scenario, in models where Lotka-Volterra competition
 is combined with temporal environmental variability, theoretical research
 has revealed that increased interspecific competition might not increase
 species compensation

Early investigations of the frequency of synchronous vs compensatory dynamics
 focused on the variance ratio, that is, the variance of the sum of the
 community biomass divided by the sum of the variance of the component species
 biomasses 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "houlahan_compensatory_2007,gonzalez2009causes"

 Unfortunately, this metric is not appropriate for communities subjected
 to community-wide environmental forcing 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ranta_detecting_2008"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, because a main environmental driver (e.g., temperature or light) may synchronize
 species abundances or growth rates at some scale, creating large variance
 in community-wide biomass, in spite of strongly competitive dynamics.
 Further research has therefore focused on specific timeframes during which
 compensatory dynamics may be found (e.g., below the seasonal scale at which
 temperature fluctuations tend to synchronize species dynamics,

 at several temporal and taxonomic or functional scales.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed, taxonomic and functional scales should be main modulators of synchrony/c
ompensation.
 On the one hand, compensation can be high between similar and closely related
 species.
 If two species of ducks A and B share almost the same niche, individuals
 from either species experience similar competition from species A or B,
 and should feel the effects of other species in the community identically.
 This favours priority effects 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "fukami_historical_2015"

, with chance due to movement events determining whether species A or B
 locally dominates, which can then provide compensation at the landscape
 level 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "loreau2003biodiversity"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 On the other hand, it could be argued that these two similar duck species
 will precisely respond in similar ways to environmental variables, which
 tends to obfuscate compensation.
 Hence, more dissimilar species or groups (within the same trophic level
 nonetheless) could exhibit more compensation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "morin2014temporal,klink_functional_2019"

 because they are more likely to respond to the environment in an asynchronous

 In this paper, we explore the level of compensation/synchrony within or
 between guilds of a wetland bird community, along either taxonomic or functiona

 Although a functional classification might appear intuitively more appealing,
 our knowledge of functional traits is necessarily partial and imperfect,
 so that a taxonomic description can sometimes be preferable

Our objective is therefore to examine how synchronous or compensatory bird
 communities are at different temporal and taxonomic (or functional) scales.
 Our dataset is ideally suited to the task given that (i) it is a highly
 temporally resolved time series with respect to the species typical generation
 times, but it also extends well beyond generation time (35 years) and (ii)

The monthly time series used for the statistical analyses have been collected
 at the Teich Ornithological Reserve, Arcachon Bay, France (44.64°N / -1.02°E),
 by the staff of the Teich reserve, over the whole study period.
 A species list of the frequent birds is provided in SI Appendix S1

 sectors where the counts are actually performed, using binoculars).
 We use for each species the maximum observed abundance over a month, which
 provides a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

monthly snapshot
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the bird abundance, that has been used to monitor the reserve since
 its inception.
 When abundance values are missing for certain species and months, we replace
 them by 0s.
 Given the sustained observation effort (all sectors are patrolled multiple
 times throughout the month by the staff, amateur ornithologists visiting
 the reserve daily and communicating their findings to the reserve staff),
 we consider that the absence of counts for a given species signals its
 true absence from the reserve.
 This creates some zero abundances for rare species at the monthly scale.
 We have not attempted to

 those zeroes (e.g., inferring the

 population) because doing so would have compromised the patterns of local
 synchrony/compensation.
 However, we did check below that having such zeroes in the monthly time
 series cannot affect our conclusions

 In the statistical analyses, we use seasonally averaged abundances (plotted

), as well as the original monthly data (presented in SI Appendix S2).
 We defined two seasons based on observations of bird presence.
 We defined a `warm season', from May to August, and a `cold season' as
 the months between November and February of the following year.
 From an ecological viewpoint, this seasonal classification separates wintering
 birds from summer residents (some of whom are breeding).
 This makes sense biologically because the two communities have different
 requirements and respond differentially to abiotic drivers.
 It is also useful from a more statistical perspective, as there is a shift
 in composition between the seasons, though winter and summer communities
 partially overlap due to a number of shared species.

 Waders and ducks have different environmental preferences, with ducks (and
 waterfowl more generally) preferring water levels allowing them to dive,
 while waders usually forage on mudflats.
 A list of all birds found frequently in the reserve is presented in SI
 Appendix S1; aside from waders and waterfowl, other common species include
 herons, egrets and cormorants (see below).
 Among the fish eaters, grebes and gulls were also present; a few raptors

where

\end_inset

 is the abundance or biomass of species 
\begin_inset Formula $i$

 in a community of

 This synchrony index described in eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 varies between -1 (perfect compensation, total biomass is constant) and
 1 (complete synchrony), while 0 represents a case where all populations
 fluctuate independently.
 Contrary to other indices (e.g.,

 its overall stability

 This is particularly important here as we perform analyses at different

 That is, we constructed two community-level time series where each year
 is associated to a vector of species abundances, one for the cold season
 and one for 
\change_inserted -2100369821 1573053662
the 
\change_unchanged
warm season.
 To do so, we averaged monthly bird abundances, for each species, over the
 season duration.
 We then computed the synchrony index for both cold and warm seasons using
 the year as our statistical unit.
 In follow-up analyses, we also differentiated periods before and after
 2006, given that a management change occurred within the reserve in 2006.
 We considered both the synchrony inside a given group (e.g., among species
 of the 
\shape italic
Calidris
\shape default
 genus) or between groups (e.g., between the summed abundances of the 7 species
 of tribe 
\shape italic
Anatini
\shape default
 and
\emph on
 
\shape italic
the sum of the 7 
\emph default

 species).
 In the latter case of between-groups comparisons, we summed species together
 before seasonal averaging, to consider seasonal averages of the monthly
 group-level abundance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We computed the statistical significance of the synchrony index by comparing
 the observed values to the distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 under the null hypothesis 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gouhier_synchrony_2014"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, which amounts to zero cross-correlations between species abundances (or
 guild-level abundances when considering functional groups).
 The challenge to construct such null hypothesis is to remove all cross-correlat
ions while keeping the exact same autocorrelation in each individual time
 series.
 Therefore, for each set of time series (each combination year 
\begin_inset Formula $\times$
\end_inset

 season for a given community), we constructed 100 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

surrogates
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in which we kept auto-correlations but removed cross-correlations between
 time series.
 There are multiple ways to erase cross-correlations depending on the resolution
 of the considered community.
 Within communities, we shifted the time-series 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "purves_fine-scale_2002"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 while between communities, we used a frequency-based approach (Iterated
 Amplitude-Adjusted Fourier Transform or IAAFT, see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "schreiber_surrogate_2000"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 We first explain the shift-based approach: the suite of abundance values
 (after seasonal averaging) is displaced by a random temporal lag 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, so that a value 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}$
\end_inset

 is now found at 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t+\tau}$
\end_inset

.
 At the boundary (the end of the time series), remaining points are displaced
 towards the beginning of the time-series, which implements a toroidal shift.
 This methods works well when comparing many times series corresponding
 to the multiple species.
 However, when computing synchrony across 
\change_deleted -666822487 1570026242
 
\change_unchanged
only two groups (
\begin_inset Quotes eld

between guilds
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

),
\change_deleted -2100369821 1573054204
 ,
\change_unchanged
 spurious cross-correlations could emerge with a shift-based approach as
 the number of possible combinations is more limited.
 Therefore, to test for synchrony between the summed abundances of two guilds
 or taxonomic units, we used the more refined IAAFT method 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "schreiber_surrogate_2000"

, which retains the frequency spectrum of the time series while

 We then compared the number of

\end_inset

 the p-value according to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

 (i.e., using the ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $(r+1)/(n+1)$

 is the number of surrogate values that are

 is the number of surrogates).
 Independence of species was rejected at the 10% threshold with a Benjamini-Hoch
berg correction, as we compare across 2 seasons and 3 periods, with partially
 overlapping data.
 This was found satisfactory based on simulated data, although power is
 low for detecting compensation (i.e., the null cannot always be rejected)
 when only two groups are compared.

 synchrony dominates at the seasonal scale.
 Using functional groups (waders and waterfowl), synchrony within functional
 groups was also prominent.
 The Gross synchrony indices are indeed mostly positive, and always positive
 whenever significantly different from the null hypothesis (no temporal
 correlation between species).
 Therefore, there is no compensation within guilds (Fig.

a and b) at the annual scale.
 This matches the patterns obtained within the entire wetland bird community
 (Fig A1 in Appendix S3): synchrony dominates when abundances are computed
 at the species level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the cold season, abundances within

 change in 2006, with species within 
\emph on

 becoming less synchronous over time, although we should mention that these
 changes are not statistically significant.
 For the warm season, the management change, which consisted of lowering
 the water levels, created little change in communities of species within
 the

\begin_layout Standard
Even though there is no widespread community-wide or genus-wide compensation
 at the yearly timescale (differentiating the seasons), there could be compensat

 a month or two, or coarser scales, over several years.

 can see that there is synchrony even at a fine temporal scale throughout
 most of the time series.

 However, over long temporal scales (

 Yet, summing species abundances within a guild and comparing the total

 A zoom on a module of three species with known competition also revealed
 compensation at scales above 5 years.
 Similar results have been obtained using biomass in place of abundance

t did not have marked effects, unless the number of compartments is equal
 to 2, in which case, significance is hard to achieve and some compensatory
 dynamics can be missed with weak environmental response.
 However, we found that if two guilds respond in opposite ways to a shared
 driver, the stronger the response to the driver, the lesser the compensation
 indicated by 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 at the whole community level.
 This might explain the low levels of compensation that we found at the
 overall wetland bird community level (Appendix S2), in spite of the clear
 presence of two guilds (waders and waterfowl) reacting in opposite way
 to
\change_inserted -2100369821 1573056626

 shared driver (here, water levels).
 Analyses at several taxonomic/functional scales are therefore warranted
 to be conclusive about compensation.

 vs waterfowl) to uncover compensation.
 The functional group classification produced some compensation between
 guilds while the taxonomic classification did not, despite the contrasted
 habitat preferences of these two phylogenetic groups.
 Using functional groups produced more logical results, although as we stressed
 above, the null hypothesis of no compensation at the yearly scale is still
 plausible as well.

We expected to see compensation at the

 irrespective of the season, because the requirements of these birds are
 different, but waders and waterfowl were found to correlate negatively

 This can be explained by a broad inflow of birds in the summer, including
 non-resident individuals that add random variation to the community dynamics
 (though other explanations are possible).

 as the observed long-term changes in species composition (more waders,
 proportionally less waterfowl; SI Appendix S2) might be due to an increased
 inflow of birds preferring low water levels (waders), and outflow of birds
 preferring high water levels (waterfowl), under an overall space constraint.
 In other words, the shift in community dynamics is likely not directly

 and deaths.
 However, it would be incorrect to conclude that such local compensation
 is disconnected from regional-scale community dynamics: which species are
 present in the reserve affects their reproductive success, which feeds
 back into regional-scale dynamics, and in turn, regional-scale dynamics

red around 2006, after which the water levels were kept at a lower level.
 We have therefore also performed yearly analyses pre- and post-2006.
 These showed very little differences during either the warm or cold season.
 However, in the wavelet analyses, we see at monthly or 5-year timescales
 more compensation after 2006.
 Since the water levels are on average more appropriate for waders and their
 overall proportion has increased, it may be tempting to interpret this
 as a consequence of the community becoming saturated with waders, but we
 caution that it is difficult to make any strong conclusion based on a single
 synchrony index.
 Similar analyses on beetle communities by

 in theory such disturbances should promote synchrony.
 In fact, like us, they might have found a little less synchrony after disturban

 We now describe a case where the biological processes at hand are better
 understood.

 Abundance time series suggested some negative correlation, but it was not
 found on the annual scale for which synchrony (or an absence of relation)
 dominates.
 Instead, we find that compensation mostly occurs above the annual temporal
 scale, approximatively on a scale of 6 years, much above the annual scale.

Overall, our results suggest to search for compensation more often

 functional groups, and over relatively long timescales, above the typical
 temporal autocorrelation of the dominant driver (e.g., above 5 years if the
 main driver is a seasonal climate).
 This rejoins the recent findings of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

 who found that increased functional differences between species tend to
 decrease synchrony.
 Our suggestion goes against calls to search for compensation within closely

, below the timescale of the main synchronizing seasonal environmental driver,
 in order to filter out its synchronizing effect.
 Although searching for compensation at temporal scales below the seasonal
 abiotic driver (e.g., temperature) was partly motivated by studies on plankton
 whose community dynamics are much faster, with much shorter generation
 times, we could have expected compensation to manifest also at that scale
 
\change_deleted -2100369821 1573057040
here as well 
\change_unchanged
(e.g., monthly).
 Indeed, movement of birds reacting to food availability can certainly occur
 within the season, and wetlands have a finite carrying capacity, so that
 there is competition for space, which could promote short-term compensation.
 We suspect that instead, because many species share common abiotic and
 biotic drivers (e.g., disturbances due to nearby hunting) even below the
 yearly timescale, their dynamics are bound to be synchronized to some degree

The attractor of community dynamics, i.e., the shape of community trajectories
 in phase space, seems to be more or less an annual cycle here: the dominant
 species fluctuate seasonally, but even though there are shifts in some
 species dynamics, no abundant species seem to exhibit violent multi-year
 oscillations.
 If we had to describe our community mathematically, a dynamical model with
 a stable fixed point forced by seasonality and some noise would probably
 be appropriate.
 This mild fluctuation scenario somehow con

 that compensation could occur more frequently for more strongly oscillating
 species.
 Therefore, compensation could be more likely for those groups at the yearly
 timescale.
 Whether or not these findings have some generality remains to be investigated
 by examining multi-species synchrony for more varied animal taxa.

In many ways, searching for abundance compensation using biodiversity time
 series data is searching for needles in a haystack: only some specific
