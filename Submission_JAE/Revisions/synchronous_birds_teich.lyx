\begin_layout Abstract
1.
 Compensatory dynamics, during which community composition shifts despite
 a near-constant total community size, are usually rare: synchronous dynamics
 prevail in natural communities.
 This is a puzzle for ecologists, because of the key role of compensation
 in explaining the relation between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
2.
 However, most studies so far have considered compensation in either plants
 or planktonic organisms, so that evidence for the generality of such synchrony
 is limited.
 Here, we extend analyses of community-level synchrony to wetland birds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
3.
 We analyse a 35-year monthly survey of a community where we suspected that
 compensation might occur due to changes in water levels, favouring birds
 with different habitat preferences, and potential competition.
 We perform both yearly analyses by season, using a synchrony index, and
 monthly analyses using wavelet-based measures allowing for scale-dependence.
 We analyse synchrony both within and between guilds, with guilds defined
 either as tightknit phylogenetic groups or larger functional groups.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
4.
 We find that abundance compensation is rare, likely due to the synchronizing
 influence of climate on birds, even after considering several temporal
 scales of covariation (during either cold or warm seasons, above or below
 the seasonal scale).
 Negative covariation in abundance at the whole community level did only
 appear after a management change in the reserve, and at the scale of a
 few months or several years.
 We also found that synchrony varies with taxonomic and functional scale:
 the rare cases where compensation appeared consistently at the annual scale
 were 
\emph on
between
\emph default
 rather than 
\emph on
within
\emph default
 guilds, using functional groups.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
5.
 Although most research has focused on viewing compensation vs synchrony
 across temporal scales, because synchrony is guaranteed at the temporal
 scale of the dominant environmental forcing, our results suggest that compensat
ion can be masked as well at some taxonomic or functional scales.
 We suggest that abundance compensation may have more potential to emerge
 between broad functional groups, rather between species.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Density compensation occurs when individuals of a given species replace
 individuals of other species within a community, either because of explicit
 competitive processes or shifts in environmental drivers that change selection
 pressures 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gonzalez2009causes"

\end_inset

.
 The community as a whole then exhibits lower biomass variation than its
 constituent species 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gross2013species"
literal "true"

\end_inset

: some degree of compensation or asynchrony is therefore a prerequisite
 to stabilization at the community level 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "loreau2013biodiversity"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Understanding why environmental variation may lead to compensation is relatively
 easy: if species have different environmental preferences (e.g., thermal
 optima), and the environment changes over time, different species will
 be fittest

 at different points in time.
 As a consequence, relative abundances will shift over time even though
 the community biomass as a whole may remain relatively stable 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gonzalez2009causes"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 However, the conditions for compensation to happen also depend on the particula
rs of the interactions between and within species in the community.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Compensation is particularly likely to occur when such temporal environmental
 variation combines with a space or strongly limiting resource constraint,
 so that individuals are close to competing in a zero-sum game (sensu 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "hubbell2001unified"

\end_inset

 or lottery-style models, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "chesson_multispecies_1994"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 When the total community size is constant over time, and the composition
 fluctuates, negative covariation between abundances then emerges by design
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "loreau_species_2008"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 since no species can increase without another species decreasing in abundance.
 Outside of this zero-sum scenario, in models where Lotka-Volterra competition
 is combined with temporal environmental variability, theoretical research
 has revealed that increased interspecific competition might not increase
 species compensation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ives_stability_1999"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and might even decrease it

LatexCommand citep
before "i.e., increase species synchrony instead,"

, though this depends on the fluctuation regime.
 Thus, in a world where total community size varies, predicting whether
 compensatory (or asynchronous)

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Early investigations of the frequency of synchronous vs compensatory dynamics
 focused on the variance ratio, that is, the variance of the sum of the
 community biomass divided by the sum of the variance of the component species
 biomasses 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "houlahan_compensatory_2007,gonzalez2009causes"

 Unfortunately, this metric is not appropriate for communities subjected
 to community-wide environmental forcing 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ranta_detecting_2008"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, because a main environmental driver (e.g., temperature or light) may synchronize
 species abundances or growth rates at some scale, creating large variance
 in community-wide biomass, in spite of strongly competitive dynamics.
 Further research has therefore focused on specific timeframes during which
 compensatory dynamics may be found (e.g., below the seasonal scale at which
 temperature fluctuations tend to synchronize species dynamics,

), in a natural reserve, allowing us to dig deeper into patterns of synchrony,
 at several temporal and taxonomic or functional scales.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed, taxonomic and functional scales should be main modulators of synchrony/c
ompensation.
 On the one hand, compensation can be high between similar and closely related
 species.
 If two species of ducks A and B share almost the same niche, individuals
 from either species experience similar competition from species A or B,
 and should feel the effects of other species in the community identically.
 This favours priority effects 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "fukami_historical_2015"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, with chance due to movement events determining whether species A or B
 locally dominates, which can then provide compensation at the landscape
 level 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "loreau2003biodiversity"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 On the other hand, it could be argued that these two similar duck species
 will precisely respond in similar ways to environmental variables, which
 tends to obfuscate compensation.
 Hence, more dissimilar species or groups (within the same trophic level
 nonetheless) could exhibit more compensation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "morin2014temporal,klink_functional_2019"

\end_inset

 because they are more likely to respond to the environment in an asynchronous
 manner (

 In this paper, we explore the level of compensation/synchrony within or
 between guilds of a wetland bird community, along either taxonomic or functiona
l classifications.
 Although a functional classification might appear intuitively more appealing,
 our knowledge of functional traits is necessarily partial and imperfect,
 so that a taxonomic description can sometimes be preferable

\begin_layout Standard
Our objective is therefore to examine how synchronous or compensatory bird
 communities are at different temporal and taxonomic (or functional) scales.
 Our dataset is ideally suited to the task given that (i) it is a highly
 temporally resolved time series with respect to the species typical generation
 times, but it also extends well beyond generation time (35 years) and (ii)
 the reserve where the data has been collected was subjected to a major
 management change c.
 2006 (change in water levels), favouring different types of wetland birds
 (so that over long timescales, there is a real potential for changes in
 community composition).

Data

\begin_layout Standard
The monthly time series used for the statistical analyses have been collected
 at the Teich Ornithological Reserve, Arcachon Bay, France (44.64°N / -1.02°E),
 by the staff of the Teich reserve, over the whole study period.
 A species list of the frequent birds is provided in SI Appendix S1.
 The reserve comprises 120 ha of wetlands, and the counts have been aggregated
 at the reserve scale (summed over 18
\begin_inset Note Note
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 sectors where the counts are actually performed, using binoculars).
 We use for each species the maximum observed abundance over a month, which
 provides a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

monthly snapshot
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the bird abundance, that has been used to monitor the reserve since
 its inception.
 When abundance values are missing for certain species and months, we replace
 them by 0s.
 Given the sustained observation effort (all sectors are patrolled multiple
 times throughout the month by the staff, amateur ornithologists visiting
 the reserve daily and communicating their findings to the reserve staff),
 we consider that the absence of counts for a given species signals its
 true absence from the reserve.
 This creates some zero abundances for rare species at the monthly scale.
 We have not attempted to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

correct
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 those zeroes (e.g., inferring the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

missing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 data with a model assuming that our reserve is a subsample of a regional
 population) because doing so would have compromised the patterns of local
 synchrony/compensation.
 However, we did check below that having such zeroes in the monthly time
 series cannot affect our conclusions.
 In the statistical analyses, we use seasonally averaged abundances (plotted
 in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Temporal-trends"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), as well as the original monthly data (presented in Appendix S2).
 We defined two seasons based on observations of bird presence.
 We defined a `warm season', from May to August, and a `cold season' as
 the months between November and February of the following year.
 From an ecological viewpoint, this seasonal classification separates wintering
 birds from summer residents (some of whom are breeding).
 This makes sense biologically because the two communities have different
 requirements and respond differentially to abiotic drivers.
 It is also useful from a more statistical perspective, as there is a shift
 in composition between the seasons, though winter and summer communities
 partially overlap due to a number of shared species.

 in ducks and members of the

 Waders and ducks have different environmental preferences, with ducks (and
 waterfowl more generally) preferring water levels allowing them to dive,
 while waders usually forage on mudflats.
 A list of all birds found frequently in the reserve is presented in Appendix
 S1; aside from waders and waterfowl, other common species include herons,
 egrets and cormorants (see below).
 Among the fish eaters, grebes and gulls were also present; a few raptors
 as well.

To examine compensation

 That is, we constructed two community-level time series where each year
 is associated to a vector of species abundances, one for the cold season
 and one for the warm season.
 To do so, we averaged monthly bird abundances, for each species, over the
 season duration.
 We then computed the synchrony index for both cold and warm seasons using
 the year as our statistical unit.
 In follow-up analyses, we also differentiated periods before and after
 2006, given that a management change occurred within the reserve in 2006.
 We considered both the synchrony inside a given group (e.g., among species
 of the 
\shape italic

 genus) or between groups (e.g., between the summed abundances of the 7 species
 of tribe 
\shape italic

\shape default
 and
\emph on
 
\shape italic
the sum of the 7 
\emph default

 In the latter case of between-groups comparisons, we summed species together
 before seasonal averaging, to consider seasonal averages of the monthly
 group-level abundance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We computed the statistical significance of the synchrony index by comparing
 the observed values to the distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 under the null hypothesis 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gouhier_synchrony_2014"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, which amounts to zero cross-correlations between species abundances (or
 guild-level abundances when considering functional groups).
 The challenge, in order to construct such null hypothesis, is to remove
 all cross-correlations while keeping the exact same autocorrelation in
 each individual time series.
 Therefore, for each set of time series (each combination year 
\begin_inset Formula $\times$
\end_inset

 season for a given community), we constructed 100 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

surrogates
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in which we kept auto-correlations but removed cross-correlations between
 time series.
 There are multiple ways to erase cross-correlations depending on the resolution
 of the considered community.
 Within guilds, we shifted the time-series 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "purves_fine-scale_2002"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 while between guilds (two groups only), we used a frequency-based approach
 (Iterated Amplitude-Adjusted Fourier Transform or IAAFT, see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "schreiber_surrogate_2000"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 We first explain the shift-based approach: the suite of abundance values
 (after seasonal averaging) is displaced by a random temporal lag 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, so that a value 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}$
\end_inset

 is now found at 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t+\tau}$
\end_inset

.
 At the boundary (the end of the time series), remaining points are displaced
 towards the beginning of the time-series, which implements a toroidal shift.
 This method works well when comparing many times series corresponding to
 the multiple species.
 However, when computing synchrony across only two groups (between guilds),
 spurious cross-correlations could emerge with a shift-based approach as
 the number of possible combinations is more limited.
 Therefore, to test for synchrony between the summed abundances of two guilds
 or taxonomic units, we used the more sophisticated IAAFT method 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "schreiber_surrogate_2000"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, which retains the frequency spectrum of the time series while randomising
 its values.
 We obtained 100 sets of randomised time series for each computed synchrony
 index.
 We then compared the number of 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{H0}$
\end_inset

 values which exceeded or were inferior to the observed value to compute
 the p-value 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

: we use the ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $(r+1)/(n+1)$

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is the number of surrogate values that are 
\begin_inset Formula $\ge\eta_{obs}$
\end_inset

, respectively 
\begin_inset Formula $\le\eta_{obs}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is the number of surrogates.
 Independence of species was rejected at the 10% threshold with a Benjamini-Hoch
berg correction, as we compare across 2 seasons and 3 periods, with partially
 overlapping data.
 This was found satisfactory based on simulated data, although power is
 low for detecting compensation (i.e., the null cannot always be rejected)
 when only two groups are compared.

 analyses for a range of temporal scales ranging from a few months to years.
 This was done in particular for analyzing synchrony within the rich wader

 and little egret.
 All wavelet analyses take as input the monthly time series data.

 The numerator corresponds to the total abundance variation while the denominato

 as two key examples of taxonomic units with contrasted preferences, we
 can see that within-genus synchrony dominates at the seasonal scale.
 Using functional groups (waders and waterfowl), synchrony within functional
 groups was also prominent.
 The Gross synchrony indices are indeed mostly positive, and always positive
 whenever significantly different from the null hypothesis (no temporal
 correlation between species).
 Therefore, there is no compensation within guilds (Fig.

 This matches the patterns obtained within the entire wetland bird community
 (Appendix S3): synchrony dominates when abundances are computed at the
 species level.

For the cold season, abundances within

 change in 2006, with species within 
\emph on

 becoming less synchronous over time, although we should mention that these
 changes are not statistically significant.
 For the warm season, the management change, which consisted of lowering
 the water levels, created little change in communities of species within
 the

: they are all synchronous.

\begin_layout Standard
Even though there is no widespread community-wide or genus-wide compensation
 at the yearly timescale (differentiating the seasons), there could be compensat
ion at finer temporal scales, e.g.
 a month or two, or coarser scales, over several years.
 When we consider the wavelet transform (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Wavelet-modulus-ratio"

\end_inset

), that is, a time-varying and scale-dependent strength of synchrony, we
 can see that there is synchrony even at a fine temporal scale throughout
 most of the time series.
 However, post-2006, there seems to be a possibility for compensation on
 a temporal scale of approximately 5 years or 3-4 months.

There are therefore contrasted results regarding the effect of the management
 change on synchrony within guilds or within the whole bird community.
 At the yearly (season) timescale, the results are unclear for both guilds.
 At shorter (a few months) and longer (several years) timescales though,
 the management change may decrease synchrony and even promote compensation.

 In contrast, waders and waterfowl are negatively correlated during the
 cold season and positively correlated during the warm season (Fig.

 Although the negative correlation is not statistically significant, it
 is consistent for both pre- and post-2006 periods.

Synchrony in a small module with known competition

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 were caused by the use of a log scale, but we found that in fact the correlatio
n was higher rather than lower on the log scale (Appendix S4).
 However, over long temporal scales (
\begin_inset Formula $\sim$

 6 years) there seems to be some compensation, which could correspond to
 the progressive change in composition within this small community module,
 that was already visible on the abundance time series plot (Fig.

\begin_layout Standard
Compensation was overall very rare at the yearly timescale (differentiating

 the rule.
 In other words, there was no widespread

\emph on
within
\emph default
 genera or guilds at the annual scale or below.
 Yet, summing species abundances within a guild and comparing the total
 abundance of contrasted guilds, it was possible to find compensation (although
 the null hypothesis of no correlation could not be rejected); in other
 words, there was some compensation 
\emph on
between
\emph default
 guilds.
 A zoom on a module of three species with known competition also revealed
 compensation at scales above 5 years.
 Similar results have been obtained using biomass in place of abundance
 (Appendix S5).
 We elaborate below on these findings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Synchrony 
\emph on

 or 
\emph on
between

 guilds
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given that we compare the level of synchrony/compensation within guilds
 (with many species) and between guilds (with only a handful of groups),
 we checked in Appendix S6 if changing the number of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

compartments
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

) in the Gross 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 index could affect its value.
 It did not have marked effects, unless the number of compartments is equal
 to 2, in which case, significance is hard to achieve and some compensatory
 dynamics can be missed with weak environmental response.
 However, we found that if two guilds respond in opposite ways to a shared
 driver, the stronger the response to the driver, the lesser the compensation
 indicated by 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 at the whole community level.
 This might explain the low levels of compensation that we found at the
 overall wetland bird community level (Appendix S3), in spite of the clear
 presence of two guilds (waders and waterfowl) reacting in opposite way
 to a shared driver (here, water levels).
 Analyses at several taxonomic/functional scales are therefore warranted
 to be conclusive about compensation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We used correlation between the summed abundances of closely related species
 (species within the 
\shape italic
Anatini 
\emph on
tribe
\shape default
\emph default
 vs species within the 
\shape italic
Calidris
\shape default
 genus) or the summed abundances of functionally similar species (waders
 vs waterfowl) to uncover compensation.
 The functional group classification produced some compensation between
 guilds while the taxonomic classification did not, despite the contrasted
 habitat preferences of these two phylogenetic groups.
 Using functional groups produced more logical results, although as we stressed
 above, due to the low power of the tests, the null hypothesis of no compensatio
n at the yearly scale is still plausible as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We expected to see compensation at the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

functional group scale
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 irrespective of the season, because the requirements of these birds are
 different, but waders and waterfowl were found to correlate negatively
 only during the cold (wintering) season.
 This can be explained by a broad inflow of birds in the summer, including
 non-resident individuals that add random variation to the community dynamics
 (though other explanations are possible).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It may be better to say that we detected 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

compensation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 rather than 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

compensatory dynamics
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 between bird species 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gonzalez2009causes"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 as the observed long-term changes in species composition (more waders,
 proportionally less waterfowl; Appendix S2) might be due to an increased
 inflow of birds preferring low water levels (waders), and outflow of birds
 preferring high water levels (waterfowl), under an overall space constraint.
 In other words, the shift in community dynamics is likely not directly
 due to births and deaths.
 However, it would be incorrect to conclude that such local compensation
 is disconnected from regional-scale community dynamics: which species are
 present in the reserve affects their reproductive success, which feeds
 back into regional-scale dynamics, and in turn, regional-scale dynamics
 influence which species are locally settling and competing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Effect of the change in management on synchrony
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although we performed first analyses on the whole time series, a marked
 change in management occurred around 2006, after which the water levels
 were kept at a lower level.
 We have therefore also performed yearly analyses pre- and post-2006.
 These showed very little differences during either the warm or cold season.
 However, in the wavelet analyses, we see at monthly or 5-year timescales
 more compensation after 2006.
 Since the water levels are on average more appropriate for waders and their
 overall proportion has increased, it may be tempting to interpret this
 as a consequence of the community becoming saturated with waders, but we
 caution that it is difficult to make any strong conclusion based on a single
 synchrony index.
 Similar analyses on beetle communities by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "klink_functional_2019"

\end_inset

 found little effect of disturbances on synchrony patterns, even though
 in theory such disturbances should promote synchrony.
 In fact, like us, they might have found a little less synchrony after disturban
ce, but the results were not clear cut.
 We now describe a case where the biological processes at hand are better
 understood.

Synchrony in a small module with known competition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zooming in on the cormorant-heron-egret module, for which we knew beforehand
 that competition for resting and roosting sites in the summer season occurs
 between, on the one hand, cormorants, and on the other hand, little egrets
 and grey herons (C.
 Feigné, pers.
 obs.).
 Abundance time series suggested some negative correlation, but it was not
 found on the annual scale for which synchrony (or an absence of relation)
 dominates.
 Instead, we find that compensation mostly occurs above the annual temporal
 scale, approximatively on a scale of 6 years, much above the annual scale.
 This may indeed be a consequence of the slow shift in frequencies cormorants
 and little egrets / grey herons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Conclusion and perspectives for theory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall, our results suggest to search for compensation more often
\emph on
 between
\emph default
 rather than 
\emph on
within
\emph default
 functional groups, and over relatively long timescales, above the typical
 temporal autocorrelation of the dominant driver (e.g., above 5 years if the
 main driver is a seasonal climate).
 This rejoins the recent findings of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "klink_functional_2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 who found that increased functional differences between species tend to
 decrease synchrony.
 Our suggestion goes against calls to search for compensation within closely
 related species but at very short timescales 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "vasseur2007spectral,gonzalez2009causes"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, below the timescale of the main synchronizing seasonal environmental driver,
 in order to filter out its synchronizing effect.
 Although searching for compensation at temporal scales below the seasonal
 abiotic driver (e.g., temperature) was partly motivated by studies on plankton
 whose community dynamics are much faster, with much shorter generation
 times, we could have expected compensation to manifest also at that scale
 (e.g., monthly).
 Indeed, movement of birds reacting to food availability can certainly occur
 within the season, and wetlands have a finite carrying capacity, so that
 there is competition for space, which could promote short-term compensation.
 We suspect that instead, because many species share common abiotic and
 biotic drivers (e.g., disturbances due to nearby hunting) even below the
 yearly timescale, their dynamics are bound to be synchronized to some degree.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The attractor of community dynamics, i.e., the shape of community trajectories
 in phase space, seems to be more or less an annual cycle here: the dominant
 species fluctuate seasonally, but even though there are shifts in some
 species dynamics, no abundant species seem to exhibit violent multi-year
 oscillations.
 If we had to describe our community mathematically, a dynamical model with
 a stable fixed point forced by seasonality and some noise would probably
 be appropriate.
 This mild fluctuation scenario somehow contrasts with the dynamics of other
 communities, such as insect pests, that have quite often multi-year cycles
 (on top of seasonal cycles, for multivoltine species), with possibly strong
 indirect interactions between similar species mediated by predators and
 parasitoids

 In this latter context of internally-generated variability (

 recently reported only transient synchrony between species of moths, so
 that compensation could occur more frequently for more strongly oscillating
 species.
 Therefore, compensation could be more likely for those groups at the yearly
 timescale.
 Whether or not these findings have some generality remains to be investigated
 by examining multi-species synchrony for more varied animal taxa.

In many ways, searching for abundance compensation using biodiversity time
 series data is searching for needles in a haystack: only some specific
 temporal and functional/taxonomic scales allow to see compensation whilst
 numerous confounding factors make the community co-vary positively at all
 other scales

 Although the knowledge of specific biological mechanisms increasing the
 densities of some species at the expense of others can help, synchrony
 will likely dominate community-level time series data for closely related
 species, even in species that compete strongly

 This is true even in cases of known mechanisms of competition for space
 or shifts in community composition due to abiotic changes affecting differentia
lly species preferences, as in this study.
 We therefore suggest that

 functionally (considering summed abundances of dissimilar functional groups)
 and temporally (considering temporal scales well above the periodicity
 of the dominant abiotic driver) may often be the best strategy to see the
 compensation that will inevitably manifest if the community-level biomass
 is to be maintained within bounds in the long run.
