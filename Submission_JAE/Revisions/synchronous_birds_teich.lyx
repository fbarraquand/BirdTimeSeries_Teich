 Compensatory dynamics, during which community composition shifts despite

constant total community size, are usually rare: synchronous dynamics prevail
 in natural communities.
 This is a puzzle for ecologists, because of the key role of compensation
 to explain the relation between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
2.
 However, most studies so far have considered compensation in either plants
 or planktonic organisms, so that evidence for the generality of such synchrony
 is limited.
 Here, we extend analyses of community-level synchrony to wetland birds.

\change_deleted -666822487 1568133353

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Density compensation occurs when individuals of a given species replace
 individuals of other species within a community, either because of explicit
 competitive processes or shifts in environmental drivers that change selection
 pressures 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gonzalez2009causes"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 The community as a whole then exhibits lower biomass variation than its
 constituent species 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gross2013species"
literal "true"

\end_inset

: some degree of compensation
\change_inserted -666822487 1568726441
 or asynchrony
\change_unchanged
 is therefore a prerequisite to stabilization at the community level 
\change_inserted -666822487 1568133112

\change_unchanged
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Understanding why environmental variation may lead to compensation is relatively
 easy,: if species have different environmental preference (e.g., thermal
 optima), and the environment changes over time, different species will
 be most fit at different points in time.
 As a consequence, relative abundances will shift over time even though
 the community biomass as a whole may remain relatively stable 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gonzalez2009causes"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 However, the conditions for compensation to happen also depend on the particula
rs of the interactions between and within species in the community.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Compensation is particularly likely to occur when such temporal environmental
 variation combines with a space or strongly limiting resource constraint,
 so that individuals are close to competing in a zero-sum game (sensu 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "hubbell2001unified"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 or lottery-style models, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "chesson_multispecies_1994"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 When the total community size is constant over time, and the composition
 fluctuates, negative covariation between abundances then emerges by design
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "loreau_species_2008"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 since no species can increase without another species decreasing in abundance.
 Outside of this zero-sum scenario, in models where Lotka-Volterra competition
 is combined with temporal environmental variability, theoretical research
 has revealed that increased interspecific competition might not increase
 species compensation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ives_stability_1999"
literal "false"

\end_inset

and might even decrease it 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
before "i.e., increase species synchrony instead,"
key "loreau_species_2008,loreau2013biodiversity"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, though this depends on the fluctuation regime.
 Thus, in a world where total community size varies, predicting whether
 compensatory (asynchronous) dynamics can occur is intrinsically difficult
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "klink_functional_2019"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Early investigations of the frequency of synchronous vs compensatory dynamics
 focused on the variance ratio, that is, the variance of the sum of the
 community biomass divided by the sum of the variance of the component species
 biomasses 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "houlahan_compensatory_2007,gonzalez2009causes"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Unfortunately, this metric is not appropriate for communities subjected
 to community-wide environmental forcing 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ranta_detecting_2008"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, because a main environmental driver (e.g., temperature or light) may synchronize
 species abundances or growth rates at some scale, creating large variance
 in community-wide biomass, in spite of strongly competitive dynamics.
 Further research has therefore focused on specific timeframes during which
 compensatory dynamics may be found (e.g., below the seasonal scale at which
 temperature fluctuations tend to synchronize species dynamics, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "vasseur_synchronous_2014"

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
Despite efforts to look for more meaningful temporal scales in community-level
 time series, temporal compensation has remained surprinsingly elusive in
 the field

), in a natural reserve, allowing us to dig deeper into patterns of synchrony,
 at several temporal and taxonomic or functional scales.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed, taxonomic and functional scales should be main modulators of synchrony/c
ompensation.
 On the one hand, 
\change_deleted -2100369821 1567431811
 
\change_unchanged
compensation can be high between similar and closely related species.
 If two species of ducks A and B share almost the same niche, individuals
\change_inserted -666822487 1568726511
 
\change_unchanged
from either species experience similar competition from species A or B,
 and should feel the effects of other species in the community identically.

.
 On the other hand, it could be argued that these two similar duck species
 will precisely respond in similar ways to environmental variables, which
 tends to obfuscate compensation.
 
\change_deleted -666822487 1568726775
Under the latter scenario
\change_inserted -666822487 1568726776
Hence
\change_unchanged

 could exhibit

\change_deleted -666822487 1568726843
This can occur because more dissimilar species are more likely to have different
 environmental preferences and the environment varies over time (e.g., groups
 of species preferring more open vs more closed habitats replacing each
 other as a function of changes in vegetation height).

 temporally resolved time series with respect to the species typical generation
 times, but it also extends well beyond generation time (35 years) and (ii)
 the reserve where the data has been collected was subjected to a major
 management change c.
 2006 (change in water levels), favoring different types of wetland birds
 (so that over long timescales, there is a real potential for changes in
 community composition).

 We use for each species the maximum observed abundance over a month, which

 of the bird abundance, that has been used to monitor the reserve since
 its inception.
 When abundance values are missing for certain species and months, we replace
 them by 0s.
 Given the sustained observation effort (all sectors are patrolled multiple
 times throughout the month by the staff, amateur ornithologists visiting
 the reserve daily and

 for a given species signals its true absence from the reserve.
 This creates some zero abundances for rare species at the monthly scale.
 We have not attempted to

 We defined two seasons based on observations of bird presence.
 We defined a `warm season', from May to August, and a `cold season' as
 the months between November and February of the following year.
 From an ecological viewpoint, this seasonal classification separates wintering
 birds from summer residents (some of whom are breeding).
 This makes sense biologically because the two communities have different
 requirements and respond differentially to abiotic drivers.
 It is also useful from a more statistical perspective, as there is a shift
 in composition between the seasons, though winter and summer communities
 partially overlap due to a number of shared species.

 That is, we constructed two community-level time series where each year
 is associated to a vector of species abundances, one for the cold season
 and one for warm season.
 To do so, we averaged monthly bird abundances, for each species, over the
 season duration.
 We then computed the synchrony index for both cold and warm seasons using
 the year as our statistical unit.
 In follow-up analyses, we also differentiated periods before and after
 2006, given that a management change occurred within the reserve in 2006.
 We considered both the synchrony inside a given group (e.g., among species

 Within communities, we shifted the time-series 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

).
 We first explain the shift-based approach: the suite of abundance values
 (after seasonal averaging) is displaced by a random temporal lag 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, so that a value 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}$
\end_inset

 is now found at 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t+\tau}$
\end_inset

.
 At the boundary (the end of the time series), remaining points are displaced
 towards the beginning of the time-series, which implements a
\change_inserted -666822487 1568134194
 
\change_unchanged
toroidal shift.
 This methods works well 
\change_deleted -666822487 1568134211
with

 However, when

 We obtained 100 sets of randomized time series for each computed synchrony

 We then compared the number of

 of each species.
 This index is close to 0 when species compensate and reaches 1 when they
 are synchronous.
 As before, the significance of each value was tested at the 10%, Benjamini-Hoch
berg corrected, threshold by 100 phase-randomizations of each species time
 series, and computation of the corresponding

 values.

 The robustness of the wavelet approach to the presence of exactly zero
 values is tested in SI Appendix S7 [I guess we may have to change it to
 S2 and re-order all of them accordingly later on].

Even though there is no widespread community-wide or genus-wide compensation
 at the yearly timescale (differentiating the seasons), there could be compensat
ion at finer temporal scales, e.g.
 a month or two, or coarser scales, over several years.
 When we consider the wavelet plot (Fig.

 However, over long temporal scales (

 There might be some compensation over very short timescale as well (within
 the season), but at very specific times and the biological mechanisms for
 this are unclear, since these species compete for roost sites, a process
 that it unlikely to manifest at such very short timescales.

At short timescales (below the season), and among taxonomically or functionally

 However, we found that if two

 respond in opposite ways to a shared driver, the stronger the response
 to the driver, the lesser the compensation indicated by

 at the whole community level.
 This might explain the low levels of compensation that we found at the
 overall wetland bird community level (Appendix S2), in spite of the clear
 presence of two

 In other words, the shift in community dynamics is likely not directly
 due to birth and deaths.
 However, it would be incorrect to conclude that such local compensation
 is disconnected from regional-scale community dynamics: which species are
 present in the reserve affects their reproductive success, which feeds
 back into regional-scale dynamics, and in turn, regional-scale dynamics
 influences which species are locally settling and competing.

Effect of the change in management on synchrony
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\change_inserted -666822487 1568281702
Although we performed analyses throughout the whole time series, in which
 there is a progressive change in composition (Appendix S1), a marked change
 in management occured around 2006, after which the water levels were kept
 at a lower level.
 We have therefore also performed yearly analyses pre- and post-2006.
 These showed very little differences during either the warm or cold season.
 However, in the wavelet analyses, we see at monthly or 5-year timescales
 more compensation after 2006.
 Since the water levels are on average more appropriate for waders and their
 overall proportion has increased, it may be tempting to interpret this
 as a consequence of the community becoming saturated with waders, but we
 caution that it is difficult to make any strong conclusion based on a single
 synchrony index.
 Similar analyses on beetle communities by

 found little effect of disturbances on synchrony patterns, even though
 in theory such disturbances should promote synchrony.
 In fact, like us, they might have found a little less synchrony after disturban
ce, but the results were not clear cut.
 We now describe a case where the biological processes at hand are better
 understood.

for which we knew beforehand that competition for resting/roosting sites
 in the summer season occurs between on the one hand, cormorants, and on
 the other hand, little egrets and grey herons (C.
 Feigné, pers.
 obs.).
 Abundance time series suggested some negative correlation, but it was not
 found on the annual scale for which synchrony (or an absence of relation)
 dominates.
 Instead, 
\change_unchanged
we find that compensation mostly occurs above the annual temporal scale
\change_inserted -666822487 1568189839
, approximatively on a scale of 6 years, much above the annual scale.
 
\change_deleted -666822487 1568137855
, and predominantly in summer as well as before 2006
\change_unchanged
.
 
\change_deleted -666822487 1568137928
This occurs because of a slow replacement of species due to competition
 for resting/roosting sites in the summer season (C.
 Feigné, pers.
 obs.), which mostly occurred before 2006.

\change_inserted -666822487 1568189903
 This may indeed be a consequence of the slow shift in frequencies cormorants
 and little egrets / grey herons.

Conclusion and perspectives for theory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall, our results suggest to search for compensation more often
\emph on
 between
\emph default
 rather than 
\emph on
within
\emph default
 functional groups, and over relatively long timescales, above the typical
 temporal autocorrelation of the dominant driver (e.g., above 5 years if the
 main driver is a seasonal climate).
 
\change_inserted -666822487 1568281827
This rejoins the recent findings of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "klink_functional_2019"

\end_inset

 who found that increased functional differences between species tend to
 decrease synchrony.
 
\change_deleted -666822487 1568281833
This
\change_inserted -666822487 1568281836
Our suggestion
\change_unchanged
 goes against calls to search for compensation 
\change_inserted -666822487 1568281866
within closely related species but 
\change_unchanged
at very short timescales 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "vasseur2007spectral,gonzalez2009causes"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, below the timescale of the main synchronizing seasonal environmental driver,
 in order to filter out its synchronizing effect.
 Although searching for compensation at temporal scales below the seasonal
 abiotic driver (e.g., temperature) was partly motivated by studies on plankton
 whose community dynamics are much faster, with much shorter generation
 times, we could have expected compensation to manifest also
\change_inserted -2100369821 1568297624
 at
\change_unchanged
 that scale here as well (e.g., monthly).
 Indeed, movement of birds reacting to food availability can certainly occur
 within the season, and wetlands have a finite carrying capacity, so that
 there is competition for space, which could promote short-term compensation.
 We suspect that instead, because many species share common abiotic and
 biotic drivers (e.g., disturbances due to nearby hunting) even below the
 yearly timescale, their dynamics are bound to be synchronized to some degree
 even below the yearly scale.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The attractor of community dynamics, i.e., the shape of community trajectories
 in phase space, seems to be more or less an annual cycle here: the dominant
 species fluctuate seasonally, but even though there are shifts in some
 species dynamics, no abundant species seem to exhibit violent multi-year
 oscillations.
 If we had to describe our community mathematically, a dynamical model with
 a stable fixed point forced by seasonality and some noise would probably
 work nicely.
 This mild fluctuation scenario somehow constrasts with the dynamics of
 other communities, such as insect pests, that have quite often multi-year
 cycles (on top of seasonal cycles, for multivoltine species), with possibly
 strong indirect interactions between similar species mediated by predators
 and parasitoids 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "murdoch2003consumer"

\end_inset

.
 In this latter context of internally-generated variability ("Endogenous
 compensatory cycles" in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "gonzalez2009causes"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), compensation is quite likely as well.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "klapwijk2018transient"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 recently reported only transient synchrony between species of moths, so
 that compensation could occur more frequently for more strongly oscillating
 species.
 Therefore, compensation could be more likely for those groups at the yearly
 timescale.
 Whether or not these findings have some generality remains to be investigated
 by examining multi-species synchrony for more varied animal taxa.

\begin_layout Standard
In many ways, searching for 
\change_inserted -666822487 1568281922
abundance 
\change_unchanged
compensation using biodiversity time series data is searching for needles
 in a haystack: only some specific temporal and functional/taxonomic scales
 allow to see compensation whilst numerous confounding factors make the
 community co-vary positively at all other scales

 Although the knowledge of specific biological mechanisms increasing the
 densities of some species at the expense of others can help, synchrony
 will likely dominate community-level time series data for closely related
 species, even in species that compete strongly

 This is true even in cases of known mechanisms of competition for space
 or shifts in community composition due to abiotic changes affecting differentia
