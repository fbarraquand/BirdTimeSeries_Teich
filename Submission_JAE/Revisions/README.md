This folder contains the new files (figures and texts) used in the first revision for JAE. While answering referees, we had to perform new analysis:

* `Simulations_response` contains tests of the power of the statistical analysis using the Gross index.
* `pvalue` contains thoughts and tests of the way the p-value should be computed using randomization, for a possibly skewed distribution of the index, which led to a new way of computing the p-value in our analysis.
