This folder contains tests of the statistical analysis power with different community size and different situations (compensation, synchrony, pairwise correlation between species and normally-distribued correlations). Simulations are performed in `MultivariateNormalModels.R`, correlation verification is done in `ShowDistrib.R` and actual computation of the Gross index appears in `Test_significance.r`.
