\begin_layout Abstract
1.
 Compensatory dynamics, during which community composition shifts despite
 a near-constant total community size, are usually rare: synchronous dynamics
 prevail in natural communities.
 This is a puzzle for ecologists, because of the key role of compensation
 to explain the relation between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.

2.
 However, most studies so far have considered compensation in either plants
 or planktonic organisms, so that evidence for the generality of such synchrony
 is limited.
 Here, we extend analyses of community-level synchrony to wetland birds.

\begin_layout Abstract
4.
 We find that compensatory dynamics are still rare, likely due to the synchroniz
ing influence of climate on birds, even after considering several temporal
 scales of covariation (during 
\change_inserted -666822487 1553006572
either 
\change_unchanged
cold or warm seasons, above or below the seasonal scale).
 Negative covariation in abundance at the whole community level did only
 appear after a management change in the reserve, and at the scale of a
 few months or several years.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
5.
 Although most research has focused on the temporal scale of compensation
 vs synchrony, we found that compensation varies with taxonomic and functional
 scale too: compensation appeared more frequently between rather than within
 guilds.
 This suggests that compensation has more potential to emerge between broad
 functional groups rather between species.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ecological theory suggests that within rich communities, where a number
 of species can have similar functions due to their proximity in morphological
 or phylogenetic space, they might exhibit compensatory dynamics 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "gonzalez2009causes"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Compensation occurs when individuals of some species replace individuals
 of other species, either because of explicit competitive processes or shifts
 in some environmental driver that change selection pressures.

This
\change_inserted -666822487 1553009315
Compensation

 is particularly likely to occur when there is a space or resource constraint
\change_inserted -666822487 1553009882
, which generates competition between species,

\change_inserted -666822487 1553009985
Compensatory dynamics can therefore arise from a variety of ecological processes.
 
\change_unchanged
Whatever the cause
\change_inserted -666822487 1553010027
(s)
\change_unchanged
 of compensatory dynamics, its main consequences for ecosystem functioning
 is that the community as a whole exhibits lower biomass variation than
 its constituent species 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gross2013species"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Compensation is therefore intertwined with community-level stability, at
 least when stability is understood as the reciprocal of variability.
 By contrast, another very frequently observed outcome on biodiversity time
 series is 
\change_inserted -666822487 1553010046
community-level 
\change_unchanged
synchrony 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "vasseur_synchronous_2014"

\end_inset

.
 Synchrony occurs when all species fluctuate in phase, and therefore the
 biomass of the community may not fluctuate less than its constituent parts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Early investigations of the frequency of synchronous vs compensatory dynamics
 focused on the variance ratio, that is, the variance of the sum of the
 community biomass divided by the sum of the variance of the component species
 biomasses 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "houlahan_compensatory_2007,gonzalez2009causes"

 Unfortunately, this metric is not appropriate for communities subjected
 to community-wide environmental forcing 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ranta_detecting_2008"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, because a main environmental driver (e.g., temperature or light) may synchronize
 species abundances or growth rates at some scale, creating large variance
 in community-wide biomass, in spite of strongly competitive dynamics.
 Further research has therefore focused on specific timeframes

that allows
\change_inserted -666822487 1553010151
allowing
\change_unchanged
 us to dig deeper into patterns of synchrony, at several temporal and taxonomic
 or functional scales.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed, taxonomic scale should be a main modulator of synchrony/compensation,
 and this explanatory factor that has been somewhat neglected for now.
 On the one hand, one could argue that compensation should be higher between
 closely related species, because functional and phylogenetic differences
 are generally correlated.
 For example, if species A and B are two duck species that share almost
 the same food niche as well as many traits, it makes little difference
 to the rest of the community whether one species gets replaced by the other
 (functional compensation,
\emph on
 sensu
\emph default
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "gonzalez2009causes"
literal "true"

\end_inset

) so that individuals from species A or B would experience similar competition.
 Priority effects and chance events could then determine whether duck species
 A or B dominates.
 On the other hand, it could be argued that these two similar duck species
 will precisely respond in similar ways to environmental variables, which
 tends to obfuscate compensation.
 Under the latter scenario, more dissimilar species, or groups of species
 (within the same trophic level nonetheless), could compensate each other
 within the whole community.
 This should occur because more dissimilar species are more likely to have
 different environmental preferences and the environment varies over time
 (e.g., groups of species preferring more open vs more closed habitats replacing
 each other as a function of changes in vegetation height).
 Surprisingly, such compensation 
\shape italic
between
\shape default
 guilds has been less well explored than within guilds, even though there
 is actually some empirical evidence for compensation between dissimilar
 guilds 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
before "e.g."
key "sinclair2013asynchronous"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 In this paper, we explore different ways to cluster the bird community,
 within or between guilds, along either taxonomic or functional classifications.

\change_inserted -666822487 1553010522
 Although a functional classification might appear more intuitively more
 appealing, it is important to keep in mind that our description of functions
 through traits (e.g., body size, feeding relations) are necessarily partial
 and imperfect, so that a taxonomic description can sometimes yield a better
 explanation of performances [REF Clark].
\change_unchanged

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our objective is therefore to examine how synchronous or compensatory bird
 communities are at different temporal and taxonomic (or functional) scales.
 Our dataset is ideally suited to the task given that (i) it is a highly
 temporally resolved time series with respect to the species typical generation
 times, but it also extends well beyond generation time (35 years) and (ii)
 the reserve where the data has been collected was subjected to a major
 management change c.
 2006 (change in water levels), favoring different types of wetland birds
 (so that over long timescales, there is a real potential for changes in
 community composition).

Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The monthly time series used for the statistical analyses have been collected
 at the Teich Ornithological Reserve, Arcachon Bay, France (44.64°N / -1.02°E),
 by the staff of the Teich reserve
\change_inserted -666822487 1553010709
, over the whole study period
\change_unchanged
.
 The reserve comprises 120 ha of wetlands, and the counts have been aggregated
 at the reserve scale
\change_inserted -666822487 1553010970
 (summed over XX sectors where the counts are actually performed using binocular
s)
\change_unchanged
.
 We use for each species the maximum observed abundance over a month, which
 provides a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

monthly snapshot
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the bird abundance
\change_inserted -666822487 1553010900
, that has been used to monitor the reserve since its inception
\change_unchanged
.
 In the statistical analyses, we use both the original monthly data and
 seasonal averages.
 We defined two seasons based on observations of bird presence.
 We defined a `warm season', from May to August, and a `cold season' as
 the months between November and February of the following year.
 From an ecological viewpoint, this seasonal classification separates wintering
 birds from summer residents (some of whom are breeding).
 This makes sense biologically because the two communities have different
 requirements and respond differentially to abiotic drivers.
 It is also useful from a more statistical perspective, as there is a shift
 in composition between the seasons, though winter and summer communities
 partially overlap due to a number of shared species.

Using a taxonomic classification of the community (

focusing on the genera

Calidris

 and 
\shape italic
Anas

 as two key examples of contrasted birds), we can see that within-genus
 synchrony indices at the seasonal scale are always positive whenever significan
tly different from the null hypothesis (no temporal correlation between
 species), i.e.
 there is no compensation within a genus (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

).
 This matches the patterns obtained within the entire wetland bird community
 (Fig A1 in Appendix 1).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the cold season, 
\shape italic
Calidris
\shape default
 and 
\shape italic
Anas
\shape default
 exhibit opposite trends in synchrony in response to the management change
 in 2006.
 However, for the warm season, the management change, which consisted in
 lowering the water levels, created more synchronous communities of species
 within the 
\emph on
Anas
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
Calidris
\emph default
 genera.
 This increase in synchrony after 2006 is matched by the functional group
 classification.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though there is no widespread community-wide or genus-wide compensation
 at the yearly timescale (differentiating the seasons), there could be compensat
ion at finer temporal scales, e.g.
 a month or two, or coarser scales, over several years.
 When we consider the wavelet plot (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Wavelet-modulus-ratio"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), that is a time-varying and scale-dependent strength of synchrony, we
 can see that there is synchrony even at a fine temporal scale throughout
 most of the time series.
 However, post-2006, there seems to be a possibility for overcompensation
 on a scale around 5 years or around 3-4 months.

There are therefore relatively contrasted results regarding the effect of
 the management change on short-term synchrony within the wader community.
 At the yearly (season) timescale, it seems to increase the synchrony (though
 the Gross index and wavelets provide slightly different answers).
 At even shorter timescales though, it seems to decrease it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More clear-cut results can be found when we examine the synchrony vs compensatio
n between functional groups (Fig.
 2d).
 Since we consider only two functional groups, the Gross index reduces to
 a simple correlation.
 Waders and ducks are negatively correlated during the cold season and positivel
y correlated during the warm season.
 These patterns are in contrast unclear when using a taxonomic classification
 (no compensation, Fig.
 2c).

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 that synchrony is in fact the rule around the annual scale and below, when

 We wondered if the patterns in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

plural "false"

\end_inset

 were caused by the use of a log scale, but we found that in fact the correlatio
n was higher rather than lower on the log scale (Appendix 2).
 However, over long temporal scales (
\begin_inset Formula $\sim$
\end_inset

 6 years) there seems to be some compensation, which may indicate a progressive
 change in composition within this small community module, that was already
 visible on the time series plot (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Time-series-of"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 There might be some compensation over very short timescale as well (within
 the season), but at very specific times and the biological mechanisms for
 this are unclear, since these species compete for roost sites, a process
 that it unlikely to manifest at such very short timescales.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Compensation was overall very rare at the yearly timescale (differentiating
 between the cold and warm season).
 At short timescales (below the season), and among taxonomically or functionally
 close species, some compensation could be found but only at certain periods.
 In other words, there was no widespread 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

functional compensation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (

\emph on
within
\emph default
 genera or guilds at the annual scale or below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yet, summing species abundances within a guild and comparing the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

biomass sums
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of contrasted guilds, community composition did change in frequency in
 the long run; in other words, there was some compensation 
\emph on
between
\emph default
 guilds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given that we compare the level of synchrony/compensation within guilds
 (with many species) and between guilds (with only a handful of groups),
 we checked in Appendix 3 if changing the number of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

compartments
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

) in the Gross 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 index could affect its value: it did not.
 However, we found that if two groups respond in opposite ways to a shared
 driver, the stronger the response to the driver, the lesser the compensation
 indicated by 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 at the whole community level.
 This might explain the low levels of compensation that we found at the
 overall wetland bird community level (Appendix 1), in spite of the clear
 presence of two groups reacting in opposite way to shared driver (here,
 water levels).
 Analyses at several taxonomic/functional scales are therefore warranted
 to be conclusive about compensation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We used correlation between the summed abundances of closely related species
 (species within the 
\shape italic
Anas
\shape default
 genus vs species within the 
\shape italic
Calidris
\shape default
 genus) or the summed abundances of functionally similar species (waders
 vs ducks) to uncover compensation.
 The functional group classification produced much more clearly compensation
 between guilds than the taxonomic classification.
 We expected to see compensation at that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

functional scale
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 irrespective of the season, because the requirements of these birds are
 different, but here waders and ducks were found to correlate negatively
 only during the cold (wintering) season.
 This may be because the summer is characterized by a broad inflow of birds,
 including non-resident individuals that somehow add random variation to
 the community dynamics (though other explanations are possible).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It may be better to say that we detected 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

compensation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 rather than 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

compensatory dynamics
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 between bird species 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gonzalez2009causes"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 as the observed long-term changes in species composition (more waders,
 proportionally less ducks; Appendix 4) might be due to an increased inflow
 of birds preferring low water levels, and outflow of birds preferring high
 water levels, under an overall space constraint.
 In other words, the shift in community dynamics is likely not directly
 due to birth and deaths.
 However, 
\change_inserted -666822487 1553012964
it would be incorrect to conclude that such local compensation is disconnected
 from regional-scale community dynamics: 
\change_deleted -666822487 1553012748
despite the importance of movements and habitat preference to the local
 community dynamics, there is certainly also an influence of the regional
 changes in births and deaths on these local dynamics.
\change_inserted -666822487 1553013034
which species are present in the reserve affects access their reproductive
 success, which feeds back into regional-scale dynamics, and in turn, regional-s
cale dynamics influences which species are locally settling and competing.
\change_unchanged

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zooming in on the cormorant-heron-egret module, we find that compensation
 mostly occurs above the annual temporal scale, and predominantly in summer
 as well as before 2006.
 This occurs because of a slow replacement of species due to competition
 for resting/roosting sites in the summer season (C.
 Feigné, pers.
 obs.), which mostly occurred before 2006.

 densities of some species at the expense of others can help, synchrony
 will likely dominate community-level time series data for closely related
 species, even in species that compete strongly

 This is true even in cases of known mechanisms of competition or shifts
 in community composition due to abiotic changes as in this study.
 We suggest that

 taxonomically or functionally (considering summed abondances of dissimilar
 functional groups) and temporally (considering temporal scales well above
 the dominant driver) may often be the best strategy to see the compensation
 that will inevitably manifest if the community-level abundance is maintained
 within bounds.
